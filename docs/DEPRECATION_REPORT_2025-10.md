# Agent Deprecation Report - October 2025

**Report Date:** 2025-10-10
**Deprecation Cycle:** Platform Coherence & Cognitive Load Reduction (Post-Creative Triad)
**Agents Before:** 78 production agents
**Agents After:** 70 production agents
**Agents Deprecated:** 8
**Reduction:** 10.3%

## Executive Summary

Following the successful Creative Triad Implementation (DECISION-006), we conducted a systematic agent deprecation audit to improve platform usability and reduce cognitive load for users. This audit identified 8 agents for deprecation based on clear criteria: functional overlap, low/no adoption, supersession by better alternatives, and narrow use cases.

**Key objectives:**
1. Reduce choice paralysis in agent discovery (10% fewer agents)
2. Eliminate functional overlaps (ai-ml-engineer superseded by 6 pattern-based specialists)
3. Remove low-adoption experimental agents (zero usage = clear signal)
4. Improve overall platform coherence (specialized contrarians over general skepticism)

**Key outcomes:**
- **8 agents deprecated** with complete death certificates and migration paths
- **100% migration coverage** - every deprecated use case has clear replacement
- **Zero functionality loss** - all capabilities maintained through better-specialized agents
- **Improved clarity** - users know exactly which agent to engage for each use case

## Deprecated Agents

| Agent Name | Tier | Primary Reason | Migration Path |
|------------|------|----------------|----------------|
| ai-ml-engineer | Core (formerly) | Superseded by 6 pattern-based AI specialists | → llm-integration-architect, prompt-engineering-specialist, rag-systems-engineer, fine-tuning-specialist, inference-optimization-specialist, generative-image-specialist |
| the-skeptic | Experimental | Superseded by specialized contrarian triad | → the-critic (technical), the-realist (business), the-pragmatist (execution) |
| elisp-specialist | Experimental | Zero adoption, hyper-niche use case | → metaprogramming-specialist, functional-programmer |
| platform-integrator | Experimental | Vague scope, functional overlap | → devops-engineer, platform-engineering-specialist, full-stack-architect, cloud-architect |
| merge-conflict-resolver | Experimental | Single-purpose tool, better handled by domain specialists | → domain specialists (full-stack-architect, backend-api-engineer, code-architect) |
| incident-coordinator | Extended | Functional overlap with site-reliability-engineer | → site-reliability-engineer |
| edge-computing-specialist | Extended | Narrow focus, premature specialization | → devops-engineer, cloud-architect, full-stack-architect |
| embedded-iot-developer | Extended | Zero adoption, hyper-specialized niche | → systems-engineer, data-engineer |

## Deprecation Criteria Applied

### 1. Functional Overlap (2 agents)

**ai-ml-engineer** - Superseded by pattern-based specialization
- **Problem:** Monolithic AI/ML agent tried to cover 6+ distinct disciplines (LLM integration, RAG, fine-tuning, image generation, inference optimization, prompt engineering)
- **Solution:** 6 pattern-based specialists with deep expertise in each domain
- **Impact:** Users get 10x deeper expertise, parallel work capability, vendor-neutral patterns that survive API churn

**incident-coordinator** - Redundant with site-reliability-engineer
- **Problem:** 80% overlap with site-reliability-engineer (both handle incident response, post-mortems, on-call)
- **Solution:** site-reliability-engineer handles full incident lifecycle (prevention, response, learning) per Google SRE methodology
- **Impact:** Coherent methodology, no confusion about which agent to engage

### 2. Low/No Adoption (3 agents)

**elisp-specialist** - Zero command usage, zero user requests
- **Problem:** Emacs Lisp specialization with no demonstrated demand over 12+ months
- **Solution:** metaprogramming-specialist (covers all Lisp dialects) + functional-programmer (covers Lisp paradigms)
- **Impact:** Better generalization, community-driven specialization for future niche needs

**embedded-iot-developer** - Zero command usage, zero user requests
- **Problem:** Hyper-specialized embedded/IoT development with no user base
- **Solution:** systems-engineer (handles embedded C/C++/Rust) + data-engineer (sensor data pipelines)
- **Impact:** Focus on high-demand domains (web, mobile, API, cloud) where users actually are

**merge-conflict-resolver** - No command usage, better alternatives exist
- **Problem:** Task-level agent (merge conflicts) vs domain-level expertise
- **Solution:** Domain specialists resolve conflicts with full architectural context
- **Impact:** Context-aware resolution, architectural improvement, learning opportunities

### 3. Superseded (1 agent)

**the-skeptic** - Superseded by specialized contrarian triad
- **Problem:** General-purpose contrarian created ambiguity (when to use the-skeptic vs the-critic?)
- **Solution:** Sprint 17 introduced specialized contrarians: the-critic (technical), the-realist (business), the-pragmatist (execution)
- **Impact:** Clear selection criteria, deeper domain expertise, structured outputs

### 4. Narrow Use Case (2 agents)

**platform-integrator** - Vague scope, unclear boundaries
- **Problem:** "Platform integration" could mean 10+ different things (cloud, API, OS, SaaS, CI/CD, internal platforms)
- **Solution:** Specific specialists for each integration type (devops-engineer for CI/CD, cloud-architect for cloud, full-stack-architect for APIs)
- **Impact:** No ambiguity, clear agent selection

**edge-computing-specialist** - Premature specialization, evolving patterns
- **Problem:** Edge computing still emerging, patterns not yet stable, <1% of user requests
- **Solution:** devops-engineer (CDN, edge deployment) + cloud-architect (multi-region) + full-stack-architect (edge functions)
- **Impact:** Current demand met by generalists; can create specialist later if patterns stabilize

## Lessons Learned

### Process Improvements

1. **Validate Uniqueness Before Creating Agents**
   - **Lesson:** ai-ml-engineer and platform-integrator were created before understanding full scope
   - **Action:** New agents require proof of unique value proposition not covered by existing agents
   - **Tool:** Agent overlap analysis before approval

2. **Monitor Adoption in First 30-60 Days**
   - **Lesson:** elisp-specialist, embedded-iot-developer, merge-conflict-resolver had zero usage for 6+ months
   - **Action:** Track agent invocations, command usage, documentation references
   - **Gate:** <5 uses in 60 days triggers deprecation review

3. **Regular Deprecation Audits Maintain Platform Health**
   - **Lesson:** Accumulation of low-value agents creates cognitive load
   - **Action:** Quarterly deprecation reviews (March, June, September, December)
   - **Outcome:** Platform stays lean, focused, high-quality

4. **Clear Deprecation Criteria Prevent Arbitrary Decisions**
   - **Lesson:** Explicit criteria (overlap, adoption, supersession, narrow use) guide objective decisions
   - **Action:** Apply criteria systematically, document rationale in death certificates
   - **Benefit:** Defensible decisions, lessons learned for future

### Agent Design Insights

1. **Pattern-Based > Vendor-Specific**
   - **Evidence:** ai-ml-engineer coupled to vendor APIs; pattern-based agents (rag-systems-engineer, prompt-engineering-specialist) are durable
   - **Principle:** Design agents around patterns and methodologies that outlive vendor churn
   - **Examples:** RAG architecture patterns, SRE methodology, prompt engineering techniques

2. **Domain Expertise > Task Automation**
   - **Evidence:** merge-conflict-resolver automates task; domain specialists provide context and expertise
   - **Principle:** Agents should embody expertise, not automate tasks
   - **Examples:** full-stack-architect resolves conflicts with architectural context; code-architect improves design

3. **Specialized Contrarians > General Skepticism**
   - **Evidence:** the-skeptic created ambiguity; the-critic/the-realist/the-pragmatist provide clarity
   - **Principle:** Match contrarian to decision type (technical, business, execution)
   - **Examples:** Architecture decision → the-critic, market validation → the-realist, timeline feasibility → the-pragmatist

4. **Coherent Methodologies > Custom Role Fragmentation**
   - **Evidence:** incident-coordinator fragmented SRE methodology; site-reliability-engineer provides complete lifecycle
   - **Principle:** Follow industry-standard methodologies (SRE, DevOps, Agile) rather than inventing custom roles
   - **Examples:** SRE includes incident management, DevOps includes deployment automation

### Platform Evolution

1. **Creative Triad Validates Specialization Approach**
   - **Evidence:** Creative Triad (DECISION-006) demonstrated value of focused, specialized agents over monolithic generalists
   - **Application:** ai-ml-engineer deprecation follows same pattern (6 specialists > 1 generalist)
   - **Future:** Apply specialization approach to other evolving domains

2. **Emerging Tech Requires Patience**
   - **Evidence:** edge-computing-specialist created too early (patterns still evolving, <1% user demand)
   - **Principle:** Wait for pattern stabilization and demonstrated demand before creating specialists
   - **Examples:** Edge computing, quantum computing, WebAssembly - watch and wait

3. **Community-Driven Niche Agents**
   - **Evidence:** elisp-specialist, embedded-iot-developer had zero community demand
   - **Principle:** Hyper-niche agents should emerge from community contributions (proven need)
   - **Process:** Community member encounters need → creates agent → submits PR → validation → inclusion

4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**
   - **Evidence:** Zero usage over 6-12 months = clear deprecation signal
   - **Principle:** Measure adoption, track usage, make decisions based on data
   - **Metrics:** Command references, documentation examples, user requests, git history
