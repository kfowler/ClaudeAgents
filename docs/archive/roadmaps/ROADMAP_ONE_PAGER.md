## Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Fallback |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Low telemetry opt-in (<20%) | Clear value prop, privacy promise, incentive | Proxy metrics (GitHub stars) |
| Low-quality community agents | Strict certification (80% pass rate), tier system | Experimental tier quarantine |
| Enterprise demand overestimated | Validate FIRST (10+ interviews, 3+ LOIs) | Focus on marketplace instead |
| Agent proliferation (100+ agents) | Ruthless demotion, quarterly pruning | Archive <5 uses in 6 months |
