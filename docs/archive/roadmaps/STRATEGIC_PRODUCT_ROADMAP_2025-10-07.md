  - Build modular architecture adaptable to platform changes
  - Diversify to support multiple LLM platforms (Claude, GPT, Gemini) for enterprise

**Risk 3: Enterprise Platforms Commoditizing Agent Collections**
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (AWS, Microsoft could bundle agent collections)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Move up value chain to workflow orchestration and verticals
  - Build community moat through marketplace and contributors
  - Focus on DX advantages over enterprise platforms
  - Open-source model creates permissionless innovation platforms can't match

**Risk 4: Vertical AI Startups with Deep Domain Expertise**
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (specialized verticals may be superior)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Partner with vertical specialists for domain-specific workflows
  - Position as orchestration platform integrating vertical agents
  - Focus on cross-functional workflows spanning multiple domains
  - Target horizontal concerns (quality, deployment, growth) where specialization less critical

**Risk 5: Cost Structure Changes in LLM Pricing**
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Impact:** Medium (affects strategic model assignment value prop)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Monitor LLM pricing trends, update model assignments dynamically
  - Build cost optimization as core feature, not static strategy
  - Provide cost visibility and budget controls for enterprise
  - Explore partnerships with LLM providers for volume discounts

### Execution Risks

**Risk 6: Insufficient Telemetry Data for Validation**
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (quality system unproven without data)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Aggressive opt-in campaign for telemetry
  - Incentivize telemetry (premium features, early access)
  - Synthetic load testing for initial validation
  - Manual user interviews to supplement telemetry

**Risk 7: Freemium Conversion Rate <3%**
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (revenue projections depend on 5% conversion)
- **Mitigation:**
  - A/B test pricing and feature gating
  - Vertical packages as premium differentiator
  - Usage-based pricing (not just flat subscriptions)
  - Outcome-based pricing (pay for successful launches, not agents)

**Risk 8: Community Marketplace Low Adoption**
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (network effects delayed)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Seed marketplace with high-quality agents
  - Revenue sharing to incentivize contributions (70/30 split)
  - Featured agent program (marketing for top contributors)
