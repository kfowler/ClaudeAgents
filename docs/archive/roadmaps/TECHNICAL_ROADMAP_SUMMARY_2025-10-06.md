# Technical Roadmap Summary - Quick Reference

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Timeline:** 10 weeks (2.5 months)
**Focus:** Close competitive gaps while maintaining quality advantage

---

## Critical Technical Gaps

### 1. MCP Protocol Support ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Gap:** Zero MCP support vs Claude Flow (87 MCP tools), OpenHands (MCP servers)
**Impact:** Cannot integrate external tools, limited to Claude Code native capabilities
**Solution:** Implement MCP client + tool servers
**Effort:** 3-5 weeks
**Priority:** HIGHEST

### 2. Agent Coordination & Handoff 🔴 HIGH
**Gap:** Basic orchestration vs AutoGen (message passing), MetaGPT (DAGs), LangGraph (graphs)
**Impact:** Limited multi-agent workflows, no formal handoff protocols
**Solution:** State machine + standardized handoff protocol
**Effort:** 1.5-2.5 weeks
**Priority:** HIGH

### 3. Persistent Memory & Context 🔴 HIGH
**Gap:** Zero persistence vs Claude Flow (SQLite), LangGraph (stateful agents)
**Impact:** No session continuity, context lost between executions
**Solution:** SQLite-based context store with lifecycle management
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Priority:** HIGH

### 4. Workflow Templates & Automation 🟡 MEDIUM
**Gap:** Manual agent selection vs MetaGPT (SOPs), Claude Flow (hooks)
**Impact:** No workflow automation, repetitive tasks manual
**Solution:** Template engine + hooks system
**Effort:** 2.5-4 weeks
**Priority:** MEDIUM

### 5. GitHub Integration 🟡 MEDIUM-LOW
**Gap:** Basic git commands vs SWE-agent (issue fixing), Aider (commit automation)
**Impact:** Limited development workflow integration
**Solution:** GitHub API client + automated workflows
**Effort:** 1.5-2.5 weeks
**Priority:** MEDIUM

## Key Decisions Required

### Decision 1: Timeline
- [ ] Execute full 10-week roadmap (Option 1)
- [ ] Execute 6-week minimum viable (Option 2)
- [ ] Execute phased rollout (Option 3)

### Decision 2: Resource Allocation
- [ ] 1 engineer, 10 weeks
- [ ] 2 engineers, 6-7 weeks
- [ ] Part-time resources (extended timeline)

### Decision 3: Scope Priority
**If time/resources constrained, prioritize in this order:**
1. MCP Protocol (Sprint 14-15) - MUST HAVE
2. Quality Certification (Sprint 14) - MUST HAVE
3. Agent Coordination (Sprint 16) - SHOULD HAVE
4. Persistent Context (Sprint 15) - SHOULD HAVE
5. Workflows + Hooks (Sprint 16) - NICE TO HAVE
6. GitHub Integration (Sprint 17) - NICE TO HAVE
7. Benchmarking (Sprint 17-18) - NICE TO HAVE

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Mitigation Required)
1. **MCP Protocol Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple tools, iterate
   - Contingency: Focus on documented use cases first

2. **Quality Certification Subjectivity**
   - Mitigation: Pilot with 10 agents, gather feedback
   - Contingency: Adjust weights based on validation

### Medium Risk (Monitor)
3. **Context Storage Performance**
   - Mitigation: Use repository pattern for backend swap
   - Contingency: Migrate to PostgreSQL if needed

4. **GitHub Rate Limiting**
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and rate limit handling
   - Contingency: Use authenticated requests

### Low Risk (Accept)
5. **Integration Testing Coverage**
   - Manual testing for edge cases acceptable

---

## What NOT to Do

**Avoid These Competitor Features:**
1. ❌ Swarm Intelligence (Claude Flow) - Unnecessary complexity
2. ❌ AI-Powered Agent Selection - Not justified for our scale
3. ❌ Microservices Architecture - Premature at current scale
4. ❌ Custom Graph DSL (LangGraph) - Adds learning curve
5. ❌ Real-time Collaboration - Out of scope

**Rationale:** Maintain simplicity advantage over frameworks while adding power-user features

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Review architectural assessment with stakeholders
2. Make go/no-go decision on roadmap
3. Choose execution option (1, 2, or 3)
4. Allocate resources (1 or 2 engineers)

### Sprint 14 Week 1 (If Approved)
1. Start MCP protocol research
2. Study Anthropic MCP specification
3. Design certification criteria
4. Begin MCP client architecture

### Sprint 14 Week 2
1. Implement MCP client prototype
2. Build certification automation
3. Test with 5-10 agents
4. Update CI/CD pipeline

## Expected Outcomes (10 Weeks)

### Market Position
"#1 Quality-Focused Claude Code Agent Collection"
- Production-ready with proven results
- Simple to use, powerful to orchestrate
