## What MCP Enables

### For Users (Future)

**Before MCP:**
- Agents limited to built-in capabilities
- No external tool integration
- Isolated from user's data sources

**With MCP:**
- Agents access GitHub, Slack, Jira, AWS, etc.
- Search user's codebase
- Create issues automatically
- Query databases
- Automate workflows

### Example User Journey

**User:** "Review our authentication code and create an issue for any security problems"

**ClaudeAgents (with MCP):**
1. Uses `search_files` tool to find auth code
2. Uses `read_file` tool to examine each file
3. Analyzes for security vulnerabilities
4. Uses `create_issue` tool to track findings
5. Returns summary with GitHub issue link

**Result:** Fully automated code review ‚Üí issue tracking workflow

## Current Capabilities

### MCP Client Library

**Features:**
- Protocol-compliant MCP client
- Stdio transport (local servers)
- Tool discovery and invocation
- Type-safe API
- Error handling

**Usage:**
```typescript
const client = new MCPClient();
await client.connect(transport);
const result = await client.callTool('search_code', {...});
```

### GitHub MCP Server

**Tools:**
1. `search_code` - Search GitHub repos for code patterns
2. `analyze_pr` - Detailed pull request analysis
3. `list_issues` - List and filter repository issues
4. `create_issue` - Create GitHub issues programmatically

**Use Cases:**
- Automated code search
- PR review automation
- Issue triage
- Development workflow integration

### Filesystem MCP Server

**Tools:**
1. `read_file` - Read file contents safely
2. `list_files` - List directory contents
3. `search_files` - Grep-like file search
4. `get_stats` - File/directory statistics

**Use Cases:**
- Project exploration
- Code analysis
- Configuration review
- Documentation search

**Security:** Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
