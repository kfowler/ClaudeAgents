## Key Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

**Risk 1: Low Telemetry Opt-In (<20%)**
- **Mitigation**: Clear value proposition, privacy promise, incentive (analytics dashboard)
- **Fallback**: Proxy metrics (GitHub stars, community votes)

**Risk 2: Community Contributions Low Quality**
- **Mitigation**: Strict certification (80% pass rate), automated validation, tier system
- **Fallback**: Experimental tier for unproven agents

**Risk 3: Enterprise Demand Overestimated**
- **Mitigation**: Validate FIRST (10+ interviews, 3+ LOIs required)
- **Fallback**: Focus on community marketplace instead

## Competitive Differentiation

**How We Win:**

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: 3-tier system with data-driven validation
   - Competitors: Flat agent lists, no quality signals

2. **Workflow-First**: Pre-built vertical packages (SaaS, E-Commerce, FinTech)
   - Competitors: Individual agents, manual orchestration

3. **Radical Honesty**: The-skeptic agent, failure museum, transparent limitations
   - Competitors: Overpromise AI, hide failures

4. **Community-Driven**: Emergence protocol validates demand before building
   - Competitors: Top-down decisions, feature bloat

5. **Cost Transparency**: 75% cost savings through strategic model assignment
   - Competitors: Expensive one-size-fits-all
