### 3. Privacy-First Telemetry Framework

**Files Created:**
- `tools/telemetry.py` - 400+ lines of telemetry collection
- `docs/telemetry-guide.md` - Comprehensive user documentation

**Features Implemented:**
- Event types: AGENT_INVOKED, AGENT_COMPLETED, AGENT_FAILED, USER_FEEDBACK
- Storage: JSONL daily logs in ~/.claude-telemetry/events/
- CLI: `enable`, `disable`, `summary`, `status` commands
- Summary generation with top 10 agents, success rates, satisfaction metrics

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- ❌ No PII, code snippets, or project details
- ✅ Opt-in by default (disabled until user enables)
- ✅ Local-only storage (no external servers)
- ✅ Plain JSON files (full transparency)

**Example Usage:**
```bash
python3 tools/telemetry.py enable
python3 tools/telemetry.py summary
```

**Commit:** `9b7c2e9` - Implement privacy-first telemetry framework

---

### 4. Agent Registry with Semantic Indexing

**Files Created:**
- `tools/agent_registry.py` - 400+ lines of intelligent search

**Capabilities:**
- **Indices Built:**
  - name_index: O(1) metadata lookup
  - capability_index: 8 capabilities (architecture, implementation, optimization, etc.)
  - keyword_index: 1,290 unique keywords
  - domain_index: 10 domains (web, mobile, ai_ml, data, devops, etc.)

- **Search Modes:**
  - `search <query>` - Semantic search with relevance scoring
  - `find <term>` - Precise capability/keyword/domain lookup
  - `stats` - Registry statistics and distribution

**Performance:**
- O(1) lookup vs O(n) scanning through agent list
- Sub-100ms search on 50 agents
- Relevance scoring: name match=10, capability=5, keyword=2

**Test Results:**
```bash
# Test 1: Mobile development query
$ python3 tools/agent_registry.py search "react native mobile app"
1. mobile-developer (relevance: 12.0) ✅

# Test 2: Database optimization query
$ python3 tools/agent_registry.py search "database performance"
1. data-engineer (relevance: 15.0) ✅
2. database-administrator (relevance: 15.0) ✅
```

**Distribution Insights:**
- Most common domain: creative (39 agents)
- Most common capability: implementation (38 agents)
- 10 domains identified, 8 capabilities extracted

**Commit:** `c8ad092` - Implement agent registry with semantic indexing

All critical infrastructure issues have been resolved, telemetry collection is operational, and intelligent agent discovery is now possible through semantic indexing.

The project is now ready to enter Phase 2 ("Focus & Differentiate"), where data-driven pruning, vertical workflow packages, and intelligent orchestration will transform the user experience from manual agent selection to automated workflow generation.

**Next Strategic Review:** After Phase 2 completion (estimated 30 days)
