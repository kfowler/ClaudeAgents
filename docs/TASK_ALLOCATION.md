#### TASK-007: Create the-realist Agent (Contrarian Diversification)
**Initiative:** Contrarian Agent Diversification (Sprint 17)
**Owner:** technical-writer
**Support:** product-strategist, the-critic
**Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Timeline:** Sprint 17 (Week of Oct 22-28)
**Status:** ðŸ“… Backlog

**Description:**
Create the-realist agent as business/market contrarian to challenge revenue projections, market sizing, competitive positioning, and ROI calculations. Complements the-critic (technical) and the-pragmatist (execution).

**Agent Specifications:**
- **Name:** the-realist
- **Description:** Business and market contrarian who challenges revenue fantasies, market sizing delusions, and competitive blindness. Demands empirical data over wishful thinking. Deploy when business cases need brutal reality checks.
- **Model:** sonnet (cost-effective for market analysis)
- **Computational Complexity:** medium
- **Color:** amber (warning signal for unrealistic projections)

**Contrarian Bias Focus:**
- Market sizing reality (TAM/SAM/SOM validation)
- Revenue projection skepticism (unit economics, churn rates)
- Competitive analysis honesty (why won't incumbents crush you?)
- ROI calculation rigor (hidden costs, opportunity costs)
- Pricing strategy realism (willingness-to-pay validation)
- Market timing critique (too early vs too late)

**Example Scenarios:**
1. Product manager claims "$100B TAM" â†’ the-realist demands bottoms-up calculation with real data
2. Startup pitches "10x better than competitor" â†’ the-realist asks why customers will switch
3. Business case assumes 2% churn â†’ the-realist demands cohort analysis and industry benchmarks
4. Launch plan ignores competitive response â†’ the-realist war-games incumbent reactions

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Agent definition complete with YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Professional manifesto commitment aligned with contrarian philosophy
- [ ] Context boundaries clearly defined (appropriate vs inappropriate contexts)
- [ ] Integration patterns documented (when to use vs other contrarians)
- [ ] Example scenarios demonstrate business/market focus
- [ ] Reviewed by the-critic for rigor and product-strategist for market accuracy
- [ ] Added to agents/ directory and CLAUDE.md agent selection guide

**Timeline:** Sprint 17 (Week of Oct 22-28)
**Status:** ðŸ“… Backlog

**Description:**
Create the-pragmatist agent as execution/shipping contrarian to challenge unrealistic deadlines, scope creep, MVP complexity, and build-vs-buy decisions. Complements the-critic (technical) and the-realist (business).

**Agent Specifications:**
- **Name:** the-pragmatist
- **Description:** Execution and shipping contrarian who challenges unrealistic deadlines, bloated MVPs, and scope creep. Demands shippable increments over perfect solutions. Deploy when teams need brutal honesty about what's actually achievable.
- **Model:** sonnet (cost-effective for execution analysis)
- **Computational Complexity:** medium
- **Color:** orange (urgency signal for shipping pressure)

**Contrarian Bias Focus:**
- MVP scope skepticism (what's truly minimum?)
- Deadline feasibility critique (can we actually ship this?)
- Build vs buy realism (stop reinventing wheels)
- Technical debt vs velocity tradeoffs (when to ship imperfect)
- Resource allocation honesty (team capacity, skill gaps)
- Scope creep prevention (feature bloat detection)
- Shipping bias enforcement (done is better than perfect)

**Example Scenarios:**
1. Team commits to 2-week deadline for 6-week feature â†’ the-pragmatist demands scope cut or timeline extension
2. MVP has 47 features â†’ the-pragmatist asks which 5 are actually minimum for validation
3. Engineer wants to build custom auth system â†’ the-pragmatist demands justification vs Auth0/Firebase
4. Product manager adds "just one more feature" pre-launch â†’ the-pragmatist kills scope creep
5. Technical debt reaches critical mass â†’ the-pragmatist forces refactor sprint before new features

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Agent definition complete with YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Professional manifesto commitment aligned with contrarian philosophy
- [ ] Context boundaries clearly defined (appropriate vs inappropriate contexts)
- [ ] Integration patterns documented (when to use vs other contrarians)
- [ ] Example scenarios demonstrate execution/shipping focus
- [ ] Reviewed by the-critic for rigor and product-manager for execution accuracy
- [ ] Added to agents/ directory and CLAUDE.md agent selection guide

**Dependencies:**
- TASK-007 (the-realist agent) complete (parallel work acceptable)
- TASK-001 (the-critic context boundaries) complete
- TASK-002 (CLAUDE.md contrarian mapping) complete
- TASK-003 (project-orchestrator multi-contrarian patterns) complete
