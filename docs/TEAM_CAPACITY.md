## Capacity Analysis

### Current Utilization (Week of Oct 8-14)

**Total Team Capacity:** ~300 hours/week (73 agents × 4 hours average focus time)
**Current Allocation:** 8 hours (3% utilization)
**Available Capacity:** 292 hours (97% available)

**Insight:** Significant capacity available. Focus is on quality execution of high-impact initiatives rather than spreading effort across many tasks.

---

### Bottleneck Analysis

**No Current Bottlenecks:**
- product-strategist at 80% but manageable (death certificates campaign)
- systems-engineer at 50% (dashboard testing, 2-day task)
- All other agents <30% utilization

**Potential Future Bottlenecks:**
1. **ai-ml-engineer** (AIL Phase 3 + Agent Recommendation Engine + Cross-Agent Learning)
   - Mitigation: Sequence projects (Phase 3 → Recommendation → Cross-Learning)
   - Timeline: Spread across 8-12 weeks to avoid overload

2. **product-strategist** (Death Certificates Weeks 1-4 + Vertical Packages)
   - Mitigation: Death certificates complete by Nov 4, then focus on verticals
   - Timeline: No overlap between initiatives

3. **full-stack-architect** (Vertical Packages + Orchestrator v2.0 + Web Dashboard)
   - Mitigation: Prioritize vertical packages (higher business value)
   - Timeline: Q1 2026 sequencing prevents overlap

---

## Skill Gaps & Training Needs

**Current Gaps:** None identified for immediate roadmap.

**Future Considerations:**

1. **MCP Protocol Integration** (Q3 2026)
   - Required: Deep MCP expertise
   - Solution: Upskill platform-integrator or hire specialist

2. **International Expansion** (Q4 2026)
   - Required: Localization expertise
   - Solution: Community contributions or specialist hire

3. **Enterprise Governance** (Q3 2026)
   - Required: RBAC, multi-tenancy expertise
   - Solution: Leverage security-audit-specialist + cloud-architect

---

## Team Collaboration Patterns

### High-Collaboration Agents

**Strategic Triad:**
- project-orchestrator + product-manager + product-strategist
- **Pattern:** Weekly planning (Mondays), Friday reviews
- **Effectiveness:** High (all 3 initiatives on track)

**Quality Gate Duo:**
- the-critic + the-skeptic
- **Pattern:** As-needed reviews for major decisions
- **Effectiveness:** High (prevented 40-hour waste on growth-hacker)

**Technical Triad:**
- ai-ml-engineer + systems-engineer + data-engineer
- **Pattern:** Sprint-based collaboration (AIL Sprint 2)
- **Effectiveness:** Exceptional (47% performance improvement)

---

### Low-Collaboration Agents

**Independent Specialists:**
- SEO agents (6 total) - Domain-specific, work independently
- Creative agents (10 total) - Asset production, minimal coordination
- Platform specialists (13 total) - Specialized use cases, infrequent

**Insight:** These agents are valuable on-demand but don't require ongoing coordination overhead.

---

## Onboarding & Knowledge Transfer

### New Agent Integration Process

**For AIL Integration (Example from Sprint 2):**
1. **Agent Selection** (ai-ml-engineer + product-manager): 0.5 hours
2. **Integration Spec** (ai-ml-engineer): 1 hour per agent
3. **Implementation** (agent specialist + ai-ml-engineer): 2 hours per agent
4. **Testing** (qa-test-engineer): 1 hour per agent
5. **Documentation** (technical-writer): 0.5 hours per agent

**Total per agent:** ~5 hours
**Efficiency for 5 agents (Phase 3):** 25 hours total

---

### Knowledge Base

**Comprehensive Documentation (45+ docs):**
- AIL: 15 documents (architecture, API, guides, benchmarks)
- Growth Validation: 5 documents (commands, telemetry, privacy)
- Death Certificates: 4 documents (template, workflow, marketing, analytics)
- Strategic: 10 documents (roadmap, competitive analysis, product planning)
- Guides: 11 documents (users guide, architecture, contributing, troubleshooting)

**Knowledge Transfer Efficiency:** High (new agents can onboard via docs in <2 hours)

---

---

## Recommendations for Optimization

### 1. Leverage High-Capacity Agents
**Current State:** 97% capacity available
**Recommendation:** Accelerate AIL Phase 3 (5 agents → 8-10 agents)
**Impact:** Faster path to Goal 1 (20 agents), higher platform quality sooner
**Risk:** Low (proven process from Sprint 2)

---

### 2. Parallel Track Strategic Initiatives
**Current State:** Death Certificates (Week 1), Growth Monitoring (Week 2), Dashboard Testing
**Recommendation:** Add Agent Recommendation Engine (Week 3) in parallel
**Impact:** Quick win (3-4 hours), high user value, foundational for future
**Risk:** Low (ai-ml-engineer has capacity, clear spec)

---

### 3. Formalize Weekly Planning Process
**Current State:** Ad-hoc coordination
**Recommendation:** Structured Monday/Wednesday/Friday cadence
**Impact:** Better visibility, clearer priorities, faster blocker resolution
**Effort:** 1 hour/week total (well worth it)
