## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

#### Risk 1: Insufficient Telemetry Adoption
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Aggressive opt-in campaign (Week 1)
- Incentivize with premium features/early access
- Synthetic load testing for initial validation
- Manual user interviews to supplement data

---

#### Risk 2: Growth Commands Fail Validation
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Already mitigated by lean validation approach
- 5 useful commands remain regardless of agent decision
- Death certificate process ready if deprecation needed
- Learning compounds for future validation experiments

---

#### Risk 3: Death Certificates Backfire
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Soft launch allows early feedback adjustment
- Quality review by the-critic prevents corporate speak
- Transparent about transparency (meta-honesty)
- Crisis response plan documented in marketing plan

---

### Medium-Risk Items

#### Risk 4: AIL Phase 3 Performance Degradation
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Phased rollout (5 agents at a time)
- Performance benchmarking before each integration
- Dashboard monitoring for regressions
- Rollback plan if quality drops

---

#### Risk 5: Competitive Copying of Death Certificates
**Likelihood:** High | **Impact:** Low (Positive)
**Mitigation:**
- Competitors copying validates approach
- Transparency requires years of consistency (can't fake)
- First-mover advantage already established
- Reframe as industry win, not competitive threat
