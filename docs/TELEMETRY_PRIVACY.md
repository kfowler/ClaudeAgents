# ClaudeAgents Telemetry Privacy Policy

**Version:** 2.0
**Effective Date:** October 8, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 8, 2025

## Overview

ClaudeAgents offers **optional, privacy-first telemetry** to help us improve agent quality and validate our tier system. This document provides complete transparency about what we collect, why we collect it, and how you control your data.

**Key Principles:**
- **Opt-in only** - Disabled by default, you must explicitly enable
- **Local-first** - All data stored on your machine
- **No transmission** - Never sent anywhere without explicit consent
- **Full transparency** - Open-source telemetry code you can inspect
- **Easy opt-out** - Single command to disable and delete

---

## What We Collect

### Data Collection Details

When telemetry is **enabled**, we collect the following metadata:

#### 1. Agent Usage Metrics
- **Agent name** - Which agent was invoked (e.g., "full-stack-architect")
- **Timestamp** - When the agent was used
- **Duration** - How long the agent took to complete
- **Outcome** - Success, failure, partial completion, or abandoned
- **Error category** - Type of error if failed (e.g., "ValueError", "TimeoutError")

**Example Event:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1728345600.0,
  "event_type": "agent_completed",
  "agent_name": "full-stack-architect",
  "outcome": "success",
  "duration_seconds": 45.3
}
```

#### 2. Command Usage
- **Command name** - Which workflow command was used (e.g., "/code-review")
- **Invocation count** - How many times the command was run
- **Completion status** - Whether the command finished successfully

#### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Execution time** - How long tasks take to complete
- **Resource usage** - Memory and CPU estimates (coming in v2.0)
- **Success rates** - Percentage of successful completions per agent

#### 4. User Satisfaction (Optional)
- **Satisfaction rating** - Yes/No feedback after task completion
- **Associated agent** - Which agent the feedback relates to
- **No comments or text** - Only boolean satisfaction indicator

#### 5. Platform Information
- **Operating system** - macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Claude Code version** - Which version of Claude Code you're using
- **Python version** - Runtime environment version

### What We NEVER Collect

‚ùå **No Code or Files**
- No source code snippets
- No file contents
- No file names or paths
- No project structures

‚ùå **No Personal Information**

## Why We Collect Telemetry

### Primary Goals

#### 1. Validate Quality-First Tier System
**Problem:** We claim "Core agents perform better than Specialized agents" but have zero data to prove it.

**Solution:** Telemetry lets us measure:
- Success rates by tier (Core vs Specialized vs Experimental)
- Average task duration by tier
- User satisfaction scores by tier
- Failure patterns and error categories

**Outcome:** Data-driven decisions on tier promotions and demotions.

#### 2. Identify Underused Agents
**Problem:** We have 41 agents but don't know which ones are never used.

**Solution:** Track invocation counts to find:
- Agents with <10 uses in 90 days (candidates for archival)
- Specialized agents outperforming Core agents (promotion candidates)
- Experimental agents ready for Specialized tier

**Outcome:** Maintain a lean, high-quality agent ecosystem.

#### 3. Optimize Performance
**Problem:** Some agents take too long to complete tasks, frustrating users.

**Solution:** Measure execution times to:
- Identify slowest agents (p95, p99 durations)
- Find performance regression across versions
- Optimize prompts and logic for speed

**Outcome:** Faster, more responsive agent workflows.

#### 4. Detect Composite Workflow Patterns
**Problem:** Users manually chain agents together, but we don't know which combinations are common.

**Solution:** Analyze agent invocation sequences to:
- Auto-create composite commands (e.g., "/full-review" = security + accessibility + performance)
- Pre-load context for frequently chained agents
- Suggest next-agent recommendations

**Outcome:** Smarter workflow automation.

#### 5. Improve Command Success Rates
**Problem:** Some workflow commands fail frequently, but we don't know why.

**Solution:** Track command completion rates to:
- Identify commands with high failure rates
- Debug common error patterns
- Improve command robustness

**Outcome:** More reliable automated workflows.

## Where Data is Stored

### Storage Location

**Default Location:** `~/.claude-telemetry/`

All telemetry data is stored **locally on your machine** in plain JSON files:

```
~/.claude-telemetry/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json            # Your telemetry preferences
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ summary.json           # Aggregated statistics
```

### Data Format

**JSONL (JSON Lines)** - One event per line:
```jsonl
{"timestamp": 1728345600.0, "event_type": "agent_invoked", "agent_name": "full-stack-architect"}
{"timestamp": 1728345645.3, "event_type": "agent_completed", "agent_name": "full-stack-architect", "outcome": "success", "duration_seconds": 45.3}
```

### Access Control

- **Only you** can access this data
- No network transmission without explicit consent

## Data Retention & Deletion

### Retention Policy

- **Local Storage:** Events are stored indefinitely in `~/.claude-telemetry/` unless you delete them.
- **No Cloud Retention:** We don't store any telemetry data on our servers (because we never receive it).
- **Manual Cleanup:** You can delete old events anytime:

```bash
# Delete events older than 30 days
find ~/.claude-telemetry/events/ -name "*.jsonl" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Deletion Rights

You have **full control** over your data:

- **Instant deletion** - `rm -rf ~/.claude-telemetry/`
- **No residual data** - We don't keep backups or copies
- **No "soft deletes"** - Data is permanently removed
- **No retention requirements** - Delete anytime, for any reason

---

## Open Source & Auditability

### Transparency Commitment

**All telemetry code is open source:**

- **Source Code:** `/Users/kfowler/Projects/ClaudeAgents/tools/telemetry.py`
- **License:** MIT - Free to inspect, modify, or fork
- **No obfuscation** - Plain Python, no compiled binaries
- **Community audits** - Pull requests welcome for privacy improvements

### How to Audit

1. **Read the code:**
   ```bash
   cat /Users/kfowler/Projects/ClaudeAgents/tools/telemetry.py
   ```

2. **Check network calls:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "requests\|urllib\|http" /Users/kfowler/Projects/ClaudeAgents/tools/telemetry.py
   ```
   Result: **No network calls** - All data stays local.

3. **Inspect events:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.claude-telemetry/events/*.jsonl | jq .
   ```
