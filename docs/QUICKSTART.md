# QuickStart Guide

Welcome to ClaudeAgents - your AI-powered development team in a box.

## What is ClaudeAgents?

ClaudeAgents orchestrates 75 specialized AI agents to handle complex software development tasks. Instead of choosing individual agents, you run pre-built workflows that coordinate multiple specialists automatically - like having an entire development team working together on your project.

**Why it's different:** Traditional AI coding assistants give you one agent. ClaudeAgents gives you workflows that coordinate entire teams of specialists - from product strategy to security auditing to deployment.

**What you'll accomplish in 3 minutes:** Run your first workflow and watch multiple specialist agents collaborate to solve a real development challenge.

## Progressive Disclosure

ClaudeAgents grows with your expertise:

### Beginner: Use Pre-Built Workflows

Start with packaged workflows that coordinate multiple agents:
- Copy-paste commands
- No configuration needed
- Comprehensive results
- Clear next steps

**Recommended first workflows:**
1. `/saas-mvp` - See complete product development
2. `/api-design` - Learn API design best practices
3. `/quality:testing-strategy` - Understand testing approaches

### Intermediate: Customize Workflows

Add options to tailor workflows to your needs:
- Domain-specific focus (`--domain=web`, `--domain=mobile`)
- Phase selection (`--phase=audit`, `--phase=optimize`)
- Layer targeting (`--layers=frontend,database`)
- Output format (`--output=markdown`, `--output=confluence`)

**Example customizations:**
```bash
# Focus on frontend performance only
/quality:performance-optimization --layers=frontend

# API testing with specific framework
/quality:testing-strategy --domain=api --framework=supertest

# Audit without implementing changes
/quality:performance-optimization --phase=audit --dry-run
```

### Advanced: Compose Custom Agent Teams

Invoke multiple agents in sequence for custom workflows:
1. Start with `project-orchestrator` for planning
2. Add domain specialists (`full-stack-architect`, `data-engineer`)
3. Include quality agents (`security-audit-specialist`, `qa-test-engineer`)
4. Finish with operations (`devops-engineer`, `technical-writer`)

**Custom workflow example:**
```bash
# 1. Plan the project
@project-orchestrator "Design a real-time chat application with 100K users"

# 2. Design architecture
@full-stack-architect "Implement WebSocket architecture from orchestrator plan"

# 3. Design data layer
@data-engineer "Create database schema for chat application"

# 4. Security review
@security-audit-specialist "Review chat app for security vulnerabilities"

# 5. Documentation
@technical-writer "Create API documentation for chat application"
```

```bash
# 1. Audit current state
/quality:performance-optimization --phase=audit

# 2. Review architecture
/quality:architecture-review

# 3. Optimize critical paths
/quality:performance-optimization --phase=optimize

# 4. Validate improvements
/quality:testing-strategy --types=performance
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Takes Too Long

**Solution:** Use phased approaches
```bash
# Instead of full optimization (8-12 hours)
/quality:performance-optimization

# Run audit only (2-3 hours)
/quality:performance-optimization --phase=audit
```

### Too Much Output

**Solution:** Focus on specific layers or domains
```bash
# Instead of comprehensive testing
/quality:testing-strategy

# Focus on one domain
/quality:testing-strategy --domain=web
```

### Not Sure Which Workflow to Use

**Solution:** Start with orchestration
```bash
# Let the orchestrator plan your project
/project-orchestrator "describe your challenge here"
```

The orchestrator will recommend specific workflows and agent sequences.

## Success Tips

### 1. Start with Strategy

For new projects, always begin with `product-strategist` or `project-orchestrator` to validate direction before building.

### 2. Use Workflows Over Individual Agents

Pre-built workflows coordinate multiple specialists and ensure nothing is missed. Use individual agents only when you need specific expertise.

### 3. Validate in Phases

Don't wait until the end to validate. Run security audits, performance checks, and testing continuously throughout development.

### 4. Follow the Output

Workflows provide detailed next steps. Follow them sequentially for best results.

### 5. Measure Impact

Track metrics before and after optimization workflows:
- Performance: Page load time, API latency, Core Web Vitals
- Business: Conversion rate, bounce rate, revenue
- Quality: Test coverage, bug count, security vulnerabilities

### 6. Build a Workflow Library

Save successful workflow combinations for your team:
```bash
# Create a custom command for your common workflow
# See docs/contributing.md for instructions
```
