# ClaudeAgents Telemetry Adoption Campaign

**Internal Strategy Document**
**Version:** 1.0
**Campaign Period:** October 8 - November 7, 2025 (30 days)
**Target Audience:** Existing ClaudeAgents users + new adopters

---

## Campaign Overview

### The Problem

**Zero telemetry data = Zero validation of our quality-first positioning**

Current situation:
- We claim "Core agents outperform Specialized agents" - **No proof**
- We have 41 agents - **Don't know which are used vs unused**
- We ship performance improvements - **Can't measure impact**
- We design tier promotions - **Entirely subjective decisions**
- We build composite workflows - **No data on actual usage patterns**

### The Goal

**30%+ opt-in rate with 50+ agent invocations in 30 days**

Success metrics:
- **Primary:** 30+ users opt-in (if 100 users exist, 30+ enable)
- **Secondary:** 50+ total agent invocations across all users (avg 1.7 invocations/user)
- **Quality:** 10+ distinct agents used (not just one agent 50 times)
- **Engagement:** 5+ user feedback submissions (satisfaction ratings)

### The Blocker

**Trust deficit + unclear value proposition**

User concerns:
1. "What are you really collecting?" - Lack of transparency
2. "Will you sell my data?" - Trust in privacy promises
3. "What's in it for me?" - No clear incentives
4. "Is this mandatory?" - Fear of forced adoption
5. "Can I change my mind?" - Unclear opt-out process

---

## Campaign Strategy

### Core Messaging Themes

#### 1. Radical Transparency
**Message:** "See exactly what we collect - it's all in plain sight"

**Tactics:**
- Publish comprehensive `TELEMETRY_PRIVACY.md` with zero marketing fluff
- Show actual JSON event examples with annotations
- Link directly to open-source telemetry.py code
- Demonstrate local-only storage with filesystem commands

**Example Copy:**
```
Want to see what we collect? Check ~/.claude-telemetry/ anytime.
No magic, no secrets. Just plain JSON files you can read.
```

#### 2. Control & Autonomy
**Message:** "Your data, your machine, your choice"

**Tactics:**
- Emphasize opt-in default (disabled by default)
- Show one-command disable + delete
- No dark patterns, no pre-checked boxes
- Clear consent flow with full disclosure

**Example Copy:**
```
Telemetry is OFF by default. You're in control.
Enable: python3 tools/telemetry.py enable
Disable: python3 tools/telemetry.py disable
Delete: rm -rf ~/.claude-telemetry/
```

#### 3. Shared Impact
**Message:** "Your usage shapes the platform"

**Tactics:**
- Explain how telemetry validates tier system
- Show examples of data-driven decisions (agent promotions/demotions)
- Highlight underused agent archival (lean ecosystem)
- Demonstrate performance optimization from usage patterns

**Example Copy:**
```
Help us prove Core agents are better.
Your data shows which agents succeed and which need work.
Together we build a quality-first agent ecosystem.
```

#### 4. Reciprocity & Incentives
**Message:** "Help us improve, get early access"

**Tactics:**
- Offer exclusive benefits for opt-in users
- Create tiered incentive structure (10/25/50 invocations)
- Provide voting rights on tier promotions
- Grant early access to v4.0 features

**Example Copy:**
```
Enable telemetry, earn benefits:
✅ Early access to v4.0 (30 days before public release)
✅ Premium trial (7 days of premium agents)
✅ Tier promotion voting (shape the roadmap)
✅ Feature request priority (your voice matters)
```

# Help Us Improve: Why We Need Your Data

**TL;DR:** We need telemetry to validate our quality-first tier system. It's optional, transparent, and local-only.

## The Problem

We claim "Core agents perform better" but have zero data to prove it.
We have 41 agents but don't know which are used vs unused.

## The Solution

Optional telemetry that collects:
✅ Agent usage (which agents, duration, success/failure)
❌ No code, no PII, no tracking

## What You Get

- Early access to v4.0 (30 days before public release)
- Premium trial (7 days of advanced agents)
- Voting rights on tier promotions
- Feature request priority

## Privacy Promise

- Local-only storage (~/.claude-telemetry/)
- No automatic uploads
- Open-source code (tools/telemetry.py)
- One-command disable + delete

**Enable:** `python3 tools/telemetry.py enable`
**Learn more:** [TELEMETRY_PRIVACY.md](docs/TELEMETRY_PRIVACY.md)

## Messaging Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Lead with transparency**
   - Show, don't just tell ("Here's the JSON we collect")
   - Link to open-source code
   - Provide filesystem commands to inspect data

2. **Emphasize control**
   - "Disabled by default"
   - "One command to disable"
   - "You can delete anytime"

3. **Explain the 'why'**
   - "We need proof Core agents are better"
   - "Help us identify unused agents to archive"
   - "Your data shapes the roadmap"

4. **Offer real value**
   - Early access (concrete benefit)
   - Premium trial (tangible value)
   - Voting rights (agency and influence)

5. **Respect privacy concerns**
   - Never dismiss privacy worries
   - Acknowledge trust is earned, not assumed
   - Provide detailed FAQ

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't use dark patterns**
   - No pre-checked "Enable telemetry" boxes
   - No hiding the disable option
   - No fake urgency ("Your account will be deleted if you don't opt-in!")

2. **Don't oversell incentives**
   - No "exclusive" features locked behind telemetry
   - No degraded functionality for non-participants
   - No bait-and-switch ("Free trial" → forced subscription)

3. **Don't downplay data collection**
   - No "We barely collect anything" (be specific)
   - No "Just anonymous data" (define what that means)
   - No vague promises ("We'll keep it safe")

4. **Don't spam users**
   - Max 1 in-CLI notification per week
   - Post-workflow prompts: once per user lifetime
   - Email: max 2 emails in 30 days

5. **Don't make it mandatory**
   - Never require telemetry for core features
   - No guilt-tripping ("You're not helping!")
   - No public shaming of non-participants

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks & Responses

#### Risk 1: Privacy Backlash
**Scenario:** Users accuse us of surveillance or data mining

**Response:**
- Point to open-source code: "Audit it yourself"
- Show local-only storage: "Zero network calls in telemetry.py"
- Offer immediate opt-out: "Delete it right now if you want"
- Engage constructively: Don't be defensive, listen to concerns

#### Risk 2: Low Adoption (<10%)
**Scenario:** Users don't see value, ignore campaign

**Response:**
- Increase incentive value (extend v4.0 early access to 60 days)
- Add new benefit: "Priority support" for telemetry users
- Simplify opt-in: One-click enable in CLI (vs command line)
- Survey non-participants: "What would convince you?"

#### Risk 3: Data Quality Issues
**Scenario:** Users enable but don't use agents (0 invocations)

**Response:**
- Add engagement prompts: "Try these 3 Core agents this week"
- Gamify usage: "Unlock premium trial after 25 invocations"
- Provide value immediately: "View your usage dashboard"
- Send weekly summary emails: "You used 5 agents this week"

#### Risk 4: False Promises
**Scenario:** We can't deliver v4.0 early access on time

**Response:**
- Set realistic timelines: "v4.0 beta in Q1 2026" (buffer time)
- Communicate delays early: "Beta delayed to Feb, sorry!"
- Offer alternative benefits: "Free month of premium as apology"
- Never over-promise: Under-promise, over-deliver

#### Risk 5: Security Incident
**Scenario:** Vulnerability in telemetry.py leaks sensitive data

**Response:**
- Immediate disclosure: "We found a bug, here's what happened"
- Auto-disable telemetry: "We've disabled it for everyone until patched"
- Patch within 24 hours: Emergency security release
- Post-mortem: "What went wrong and how we'll prevent it"

---

   - Archive unused agents (0 invocations in 90 days)

2. **Create composite workflows**
   - Analyze agent chaining patterns
   - Auto-create composite commands (e.g., "/full-review")
   - Launch composite command library

3. **Iterate on incentive program**
