# Growth Hacker Agent: Debate Analysis

## Core Disagreements

### 1. **Problem Definition**
- **Optimist View**: Technical founders need growth expertise they don't have
- **Skeptic View**: This is a prompt engineering problem, not a capability gap
- **Reality Check**: No user research validates this need specifically

### 2. **Unique Value Proposition**
- **Optimist View**: Combines strategy + implementation specifically for growth
- **Skeptic View**: Existing agents can handle this with proper prompts
- **Reality Check**: Overlap with product-strategist, product-manager, and full-stack-architect is significant

### 3. **Scope Boundary**
- **Optimist View**: Can be scoped to product-led growth MVP
- **Skeptic View**: "Growth" is inherently unbounded and will sprawl
- **Reality Check**: Even "product-led growth" includes 10+ subdisciplines

## Tradeoff Matrix

| Dimension | Benefits | Risks | Costs |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Market Fit** | Addresses common founder pain point | May not trust AI for growth decisions | User research needed (2 weeks) |
| **Product Differentiation** | First AI growth automation tool | Competes with human growth consultants | Positioning effort required |
| **Technical Feasibility** | Reuses existing agent patterns | Scope creep inevitable | 3-4 week development |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Extends AIL ecosystem naturally | Dilutes focus from core infrastructure | Delays Sprint 2 deliverables |
| **Maintenance** | Leverages existing infrastructure | Another agent to maintain/update | Ongoing prompt engineering |

## Hidden Assumptions Exposed

1. **Assumption**: Technical founders want automated growth advice
   - **Reality**: No evidence; they might prefer human expertise for strategic decisions

2. **Assumption**: Growth tactics can be codified into repeatable patterns
   - **Reality**: Growth is highly context-dependent; what works for B2B SaaS won't work for consumer mobile

3. **Assumption**: A specialized agent is better than enhancing existing ones
   - **Reality**: Could add growth capabilities to product-manager instead

4. **Assumption**: "Growth hacker" is a meaningful, distinct role
   - **Reality**: It's often a rebranding of product marketing + data analysis

## Evidence Gaps

- No user interviews with technical founders about growth pain points
- No failed attempts to solve this with existing agents documented
- No competitive analysis of growth automation tools
- No validation that AI-generated growth tactics outperform templates/frameworks

## Real Problem vs Perceived Problem

**Perceived Problem**: "Founders need growth expertise"

**Real Problem (Hypothesis)**: Founders need help translating growth strategies into technical implementations

**Better Solution?**: Growth implementation templates/commands that work with existing agents
