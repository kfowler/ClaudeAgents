## CRITICAL PRIORITIES (Sprint 1: Weeks 1-2)

### 1. Model Assignment System ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Impact:** HIGH | **Effort:** LOW | **Timeline:** Week 1

**Problem:** No cost optimization strategy; wshobson/agents has explicit Haiku/Sonnet/Opus assignments

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `model` field to agent frontmatter schema (haiku | sonnet | opus)
- [ ] Add `computational_complexity` field (low | medium | high)
- [ ] Assign models to all 28 existing agents:
  - **Haiku (8 agents):** merge-conflict-resolver, elisp-specialist, digital-artist, video-director, audio-engineer, 3d-modeler, comedy-writer, tv-writer
  - **Sonnet (14 agents):** full-stack-architect, mobile-developer, data-engineer, devops-engineer, platform-integrator, linux-sysadmin, accessibility-expert, legacy-specialist, functional-programmer, metaprogramming-specialist, product-strategist, qa-test-engineer, creative-catalyst, project-orchestrator
  - **Opus (6 agents):** ai-ml-engineer, systems-engineer, code-architect, security-audit-specialist, the-critic
- [ ] Update `tools/validate_agents.py` to validate model field
- [ ] Update `agents/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` with model field
- [ ] Create `docs/model-assignment-strategy.md` documenting:
  - Model selection criteria
  - Cost optimization guidelines
  - Computational complexity ratings
  - When to override defaults
- [ ] Update README.md with model distribution statistics
- [ ] Update tests to validate model assignments

**Files to Modify:**
- All 28 agent files in `agents/*.md`
- `tools/validate_agents.py` (add model validation)
- `agents/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`
- `README.md`
- `tests/test_agent_integration.py`

**Success Metrics:**
- 100% of agents have model assignments
- Validation enforces model field
- Documentation published

### 2. Fix Agent Boundary Conflicts ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Impact:** HIGH | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Timeline:** Week 1-2

**Problem:** Overlapping responsibilities causing coordination confusion

#### Conflict 1: full-stack-architect â†” mobile-developer (React Native)
**Fix:** Update both agent files:
- `agents/full-stack-architect.md`:
  - Remove React Native from scope
  - Add "For native mobile or React Native, delegate to mobile-developer"
  - Focus on web-first frameworks only (React, Next.js, Svelte, Vue, Remix)

- `agents/mobile-developer.md`:
  - Explicitly own React Native and Flutter
  - Add "React Native apps are mobile-first; coordinate with full-stack-architect for web admin panels"

#### Conflict 2: code-architect â†” all specialists (code review)
**Fix:** Update `agents/code-architect.md`:
- Add clear escalation protocol:
  - "Specialists perform domain-specific code review during implementation"
  - "code-architect performs holistic architectural review after completion"
  - "For conflicts, code-architect has final architectural authority"
- Add ACP message template for coordination

#### Conflict 3: devops-engineer â†” linux-sysadmin (infrastructure)
**Fix:** Clear separation:
- `agents/devops-engineer.md`:
  - Focus: CI/CD, containers, orchestration, IaC, cloud services
  - "For OS-level administration, security hardening, or bare-metal, delegate to linux-sysadmin"

- `agents/linux-sysadmin.md`:
  - Focus: OS configuration, security hardening, performance tuning, system administration
  - "For application deployment pipelines and cloud orchestration, delegate to devops-engineer"

#### Conflict 4: data-engineer â†” missing database-administrator
**Fix:** Create new agent + update existing:
- Create `agents/database-administrator.md` (see Sprint 2)
- Update `agents/data-engineer.md`:
  - Focus on data pipelines, ETL, analytics, ML data infrastructure
  - "For production database operations, backup/recovery, or performance tuning, delegate to database-administrator"

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update `agents/full-stack-architect.md` (React Native scope)
- [ ] Update `agents/mobile-developer.md` (React Native ownership)
- [ ] Update `agents/code-architect.md` (escalation protocol)
- [ ] Update `agents/devops-engineer.md` (infrastructure boundary)
- [ ] Update `agents/linux-sysadmin.md` (operations boundary)
- [ ] Update `agents/data-engineer.md` (database operations boundary)
