- **Sprint 9**: Development workflow commands (api-design, database-design)
- **Sprint 10**: Documentation enhancements (SEO guide, business operations guide)
- **Future**: Optional specialized agents (game-developer, sre-specialist, blockchain-engineer)

### üìù Session 2 Reflections & Lessons Learned

**What Worked Well:**
1. **Agent-Command Pairing**: Creating agents first, then workflow commands maximizes value
   - Sprint 4+5: Built 6 SEO agents ‚Üí Sprint 6: Created 4 SEO commands leveraging all agents
   - Sprint 4: Built 3 business agents ‚Üí Sprint 7: Created 2 business commands
   - Pattern: Agents enable capabilities, commands operationalize workflows

2. **Complete Suites Over Individual Features**: Focus on complete ecosystems
   - SEO suite (6 agents + 4 commands) provides end-to-end SEO workflow
   - Business suite (3 agents + 2 commands) covers requirements ‚Üí roadmap
   - Better than scattered individual agents without supporting commands

3. **Proper Development Process**: Feature branches + atomic commits + agent delegation = success
   - Zero breaking changes across 7 sprints
   - Easy rollback if needed (each sprint isolated)
   - Clear git history for future maintenance

4. **Strategic Model Assignment**: 75.6% cost savings maintained while growing 46%
   - New agents assigned appropriate models (business/SEO = Sonnet, not Opus)
   - Cost efficiency scales with growth

**Improvement Opportunities:**
1. **Command Backlog Growing**: 37 commands vs. target of 50+
   - Need 13+ more commands for competitive parity
   - Priority: Quality commands (code-quality-review, performance-optimization)
   - Priority: Development commands (api-design, database-design, microservices-scaffold)

2. **Documentation Lag**: Agent/command growth outpacing documentation updates
   - Need: SEO agents usage guide
   - Need: Business operations workflow guide
   - Need: Updated examples and case studies

3. **Validation Coverage**: Tests pass but could be more comprehensive
   - Current: 13 integration tests (agent parsing, references, metadata)
   - Opportunity: Add command validation tests
   - Opportunity: Add agent boundary conflict tests

**Velocity Trends:**
- Sprint 4: 3 agents (1,768 lines) in ~3-4 hours
- Sprint 5: 3 agents (2,359 lines) in ~3-4 hours
- Sprint 6: 3 commands (1,800 lines) in ~2-3 hours
- Sprint 7: 2 commands (1,773 lines) in ~2-3 hours
- **Average**: ~600-700 lines/hour when focused
- **Efficiency**: Agent delegation to code-architect maintains quality at speed

**Strategic Insights:**
1. **70/30 Rule**: 70% agents in Sprints 4-5, 30% commands in Sprints 6-7
   - Build capabilities first, operationalize second
   - Commands without agents = limited value
   - Agents without commands = unrealized potential

2. **Suite Completeness**: Complete suites (SEO, Business) more valuable than individual agents
   - SEO suite: Technical foundation (Phase 1) + Strategic optimization (Phase 2) + Workflow commands
   - Business suite: Requirements + Product + Documentation + Workflow commands
   - Future pattern: Identify domain ‚Üí Build agent suite ‚Üí Create workflow commands

3. **Competitive Positioning**:
   - SEO: 6 agents vs. wshobson 9 (67% coverage with strategic focus)
   - Business: 3 agents (new capability, competitive advantage)
   - Commands: 37 vs. wshobson 52 (71% coverage, closing gap)
   - Quality over quantity: Our SEO suite is comprehensive despite fewer agents

**Next Session Goals:**
1. Reach 50 commands (13 more needed)
2. Create quality workflow commands (code-quality-review, performance-optimization)
3. Create development workflow commands (api-design, database-design)
4. Write comprehensive guides (SEO, Business Operations)
5. Consider specialized agents (game-developer, sre-specialist) if demand exists
