- Provide recommendations for security hardening

**Target Use Cases:**
- Pre-production database audits
- Security compliance assessments (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)
- Post-incident schema reviews
- Quarterly database health checks

**Expected Impact:**
- Catch security vulnerabilities before production
- Improve data quality and consistency
- Reduce schema-related production incidents

## What Actually Happened

**Usage Statistics (Lifetime):**
- Total invocations: 12
- Unique users: 4
- Average rating: 3.8/5.0
- Completion rate: 67%
- Support tickets filed: 3 (confusion about vs. database-optimization)

**User Feedback (Actual):**
> "I used /quality:database-review but it didn't check performance. Then I found /database-optimization which did performance but not security. Which one do I use?"

> "Why are there two database commands? They seem to do similar things but I can't tell the difference from the descriptions."

> "The database-review output was helpful for security, but I still needed to run database-optimization. Can't these be combined?"

**Reality Check:**
- ‚ùå **65% overlap** with existing /database-optimization command (both checked schema design, both reviewed indexes)
- ‚ùå **User confusion:** 3 support tickets asking "which database command should I use?"
- ‚ùå **Low adoption:** Only 12 invocations in 23 days vs. 47 for database-optimization in same period
- ‚úÖ **Security focus was valuable:** Security assessment portions were genuinely useful and missing from database-optimization

**Behavioral Patterns Observed:**
- Users would run database-optimization first (better known, earlier in alphabet)
- When database-review mentioned in docs, users asked "do I need both?"
- All 4 users who tried database-review also ran database-optimization (100% overlap)
- Users wanted "one comprehensive database check" not "two specialized checks"

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause of Death:** Artificial scope separation created user confusion without delivering enough unique value to justify standalone existence.

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Poor Market Fit:** We assumed users wanted separate "quality review" and "performance optimization" commands. Reality: users want comprehensive database assessment and don't care about our internal categorization. They think "check my database" not "check my database security separately from performance."

2. **Premature Abstraction:** Created two commands before validating users actually wanted separation. Should have started with one comprehensive command, then split only if users requested specialized workflows.

3. **Organizational Misalignment:** Created to fit our `/quality/*` command structure (organizational preference) rather than user mental model. Users search for "database" not "quality review for databases."

**Warning Signs Ignored:**
- Week 1: First user asked "what's the difference between these two database commands?" - we wrote better docs instead of questioning the separation
- Week 2: Analytics showed 100% of database-review users also ran database-optimization - we assumed this was intentional workflow, not confusion
- Week 3: Support ticket explicitly requested "just one database command" - we dismissed as edge case, but it was the core problem

**What We Got Wrong (Assumptions):**
- **Market Assumption:** Believed users wanted specialized tools for different database concerns. Truth: Users want comprehensive "check everything" commands and handle their own prioritization.
- **Technical Assumption:** Thought separating concerns was architecturally cleaner. Truth: Agent composition allows comprehensive commands without code duplication - we optimized for our convenience, not user experience.
- **User Assumption:** Assumed users understood quality/performance distinction. Truth: These categories are developer mental models, not user mental models. Users think in domain objects (database, API, frontend) not aspect layers (quality, performance, security).

**Lessons Learned:**
- üéì **Domain over aspects:** Organize commands by domain objects (database, API, frontend) not cross-cutting concerns (quality, performance). Users search by "what" not "why."
- üéì **Validate separation before implementation:** Don't create two commands until users explicitly request the separation. Start comprehensive, split only when usage patterns demand it.
- üéì **100% user overlap is a red flag:** If everyone using command A also uses command B, they should probably be one command with optional focus areas.
- üéì **Support tickets are user research:** "Which command should I use?" is not a documentation problem - it's a product design problem. Better docs can't fix poor command boundaries.

## Superseded By

**Recommended Alternative:**
- **Command:** /development:database-optimization
- **Why Better:**
  - Comprehensive coverage: performance optimization + security assessment + schema quality in one workflow
  - Clear scope: "optimize existing database" (vs. database-design's "create new schema")
  - No user decision paralysis: one command for all database health concerns
  - 8-12 hour workflow covers everything database-review did, plus performance tuning
- **Migration Path:**
  ```bash
  # Old approach (confusing):
  /quality:database-review          # Security + schema quality
  /database-optimization            # Performance tuning

  # New approach (clear):
  /development:database-optimization # Everything in one workflow
  # Phases 1-5: Performance (original scope)
  # Phase 6: Security assessment (from database-review)
  # Phase 7: Schema quality (from database-review)
  ```
- **What's Different:**
  - Phases 6-7 added to database-optimization are the unique value from database-review
  - Users can run full 8-12 hour workflow or focus on phases 1-5 for performance-only (6-8 hours)
  - Single command eliminates "which one?" decision paralysis

## Postmortem

**What We Got Wrong:**

We created database-review because we fell in love with our command taxonomy (`/quality/*` for reviews, `/development/*` for implementation) without validating users shared that mental model. The technical distinction between "quality review" and "performance optimization" made sense to us as developers, but users don't categorize their work that way. They categorize by domain objects: "I need to check my database" not "I need quality review, and separately, performance optimization."

The critical mistake was creating two commands simultaneously rather than starting with one comprehensive command and splitting only when usage patterns demanded it. We had zero evidence users wanted separate commands - we just assumed organizational cleanliness (commands in tidy categories) would translate to user value. It didn't.

When Week 1 feedback showed confusion, we wrote better documentation explaining the distinction. Classic tech company mistake: users struggling to choose between two products isn't a communication problem, it's a product problem. No amount of documentation can rescue a poor command boundary.

**What We'd Do Differently:**

1. **Start comprehensive, split on demand:** Launch database-optimization with all capabilities (performance + security + quality). Only create database-review if usage data shows users wanting "security-only" workflows without performance tuning.

2. **Validate command boundaries with user interviews:** Before creating two commands, ask 5 users: "Would you want separate commands for database security vs. performance, or one comprehensive database health check?" We assumed; we should have asked.

3. **Treat 100% overlap as invalidation:** When analytics showed every database-review user also used database-optimization, that should have triggered immediate consolidation discussion, not better onboarding docs.

**What We'd Keep:**

The security assessment and schema quality content was genuinely valuable - users wanted this. The mistake wasn't the capabilities, it was the packaging. Those features now live in database-optimization phases 6-7 where users can actually find and use them.

**Cost of This Failure:**
- Development time: 18 hours (command creation, docs, testing)
- Opportunity cost: Could have built database migration tooling users actually requested
- User impact: 4 users experienced confusion, 3 filed support tickets, all wasted time running two commands instead of one
- Technical debt created: Minimal (consolidation was clean, no breaking changes for the 12 total invocations)

**Who This Helps:**
- **Future us:** When tempted to create specialized commands, demand evidence users want the separation. "It's architecturally cleaner" is not user value.
- **Competitors:** Don't organize commands by your internal taxonomy. Organize by user mental models (domain objects, not aspects).
- **Users:** You now have one database command that does everything. We removed the "which one?" tax on your cognitive load.
- **Open Source Community:** Command proliferation is a trap. Fewer comprehensive commands beat many specialized ones until usage patterns prove otherwise.

## Appendix: Historical Context

**Related Decisions:**
- Command consolidation wave (Oct 8, 2025): Part of broader effort to reduce command sprawl
- See also: api-testing-strategy and test-coverage consolidation (same pattern)

**References:**
- [Original consolidation commit](https://github.com/your-org/ClaudeAgents/commit/223b6ec) - includes migration of security content to database-optimization
- Support tickets: #47, #52, #61 - "which database command should I use?"

**Preservation Note:**
This death certificate is a permanent historical record. The database-review command documentation has been archived in commit 223b6ec~1 for archaeological purposes. The valuable security and quality assessment capabilities live on in /development:database-optimization phases 6-7.
