# Death Certificate: elisp-specialist

**Agent Name:** elisp-specialist
**Date of Creation:** 2024 (early agent)
**Date of Death:** 2025-10-10
**Lifespan:** ~12-18 months
**Tier:** Experimental
**Cause of Death:** Zero adoption, hyper-niche use case

## Detailed Autopsy

**Symptoms Leading to Death:**
- Zero command usage across all 68 commands
- Zero documentation references outside CLAUDE.md keyword list
- Emacs Lisp is hyper-specialized language (only Emacs customization)
- Modern Emacs users increasingly use LSP + general programming languages
- No user requests or examples involving Emacs Lisp
- Better served by metaprogramming-specialist (covers Lisp family) or functional-programmer (covers Lisp paradigms)

**Root Causes:**
- **Hyper-Specialization**: Single-language, single-editor focus (Emacs Lisp for Emacs only)
- **Declining Market**: Emacs user base shrinking, younger developers prefer VSCode/Vim/Zed
- **Better Alternatives**: metaprogramming-specialist covers Lisp macros, functional-programmer covers Lisp paradigms
- **No Unique Value**: Nothing elisp-specialist can do that metaprogramming-specialist + functional-programmer can't do better

## Lessons Learned

1. **Hyper-Niche Agents Need Clear Demand:** Single-language, single-editor agents require demonstrated user demand before platform inclusion. Zero usage in 12+ months = clear signal.

2. **Favor Generalizable Skills:** metaprogramming-specialist (Lisp family, macros, DSLs) provides more value than elisp-specialist (Emacs Lisp only). Generalizable skills have longer half-life.

3. **Community-Driven Specialization:** Hyper-niche agents should come from community contributions (proven demand) rather than speculative platform additions.

## Migration Path

**For users who might have used elisp-specialist:**

**Use Case 1: Emacs Lisp customization, .emacs configuration**
→ **Replacement:** `metaprogramming-specialist`
→ **Why:** Covers Lisp macros, metaprogramming patterns, DSL design. Emacs Lisp is a Lisp dialect—metaprogramming-specialist has the expertise.

**Use Case 2: Functional programming in Emacs Lisp**
→ **Replacement:** `functional-programmer`
→ **Why:** Covers functional paradigms (higher-order functions, immutability, recursion) across Lisp family (Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Emacs Lisp).

**Use Case 3: General Emacs configuration (non-Lisp)**
→ **Replacement:** `full-stack-architect` or `systems-engineer`
→ **Why:** Modern Emacs configuration increasingly uses LSP, tree-sitter, and external tools. General-purpose agents handle these well.

**Use Case 4: Writing Emacs packages/modes**
→ **Replacement:** `metaprogramming-specialist` + `functional-programmer`
→ **Why:** Package development requires both metaprogramming expertise (macros, hygiene) and functional programming patterns.

**Search Keyword Redirects:**
- "Emacs Lisp", "elisp", ".emacs", "init.el" → `metaprogramming-specialist`
- "Emacs package", "Emacs mode", "defun", "defmacro" → `metaprogramming-specialist`
- "functional Emacs Lisp", "higher-order functions in elisp" → `functional-programmer`

## Final Notes

The death of elisp-specialist is not a judgment on Emacs or Emacs Lisp—it's a data-driven decision based on zero adoption over 12+ months. Emacs remains a powerful editor, but:

1. **Market Reality**: Emacs user base is small and shrinking (VSCode, Vim, Zed dominate)
2. **Better Generalists**: metaprogramming-specialist + functional-programmer cover Emacs Lisp better than single-purpose agent
3. **Community-First**: If Emacs Lisp demand emerges, it should come from community contributions (proven need)

**Platform gains:**
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: One fewer hyper-niche agent to evaluate
- **Better Generalization**: metaprogramming-specialist covers all Lisp dialects, not just Emacs Lisp
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Zero usage = clear deprecation signal

This deprecation validates: **Agents must demonstrate adoption or face retirement. Speculative niche agents don't earn their slot.**
