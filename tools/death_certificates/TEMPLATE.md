## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause of Death:** [One sentence diagnosis - be brutally specific]

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **[Factor category - e.g., "Poor Market Fit"]:** [Detailed explanation with evidence]
2. **[Factor category - e.g., "Technical Limitations"]:** [Detailed explanation with evidence]
3. **[Factor category - e.g., "Organizational Misalignment"]:** [Detailed explanation with evidence]

**Warning Signs Ignored:**
- Week [X]: [Early signal we missed - what data point we dismissed]
- Week [X]: [Clear signal we rationalized away - what feedback we ignored]
- Week [X]: [Obvious signal we couldn't ignore - what finally forced action]

**What We Got Wrong (Assumptions):**
- **Market Assumption:** [What we believed vs. what was true]
- **Technical Assumption:** [What we believed vs. what was true]
- **User Assumption:** [What we believed vs. what was true]

**Lessons Learned:**
- üéì [Specific lesson that prevents future failures - actionable, not platitude]
- üéì [Specific lesson about user research or validation]
- üéì [Specific lesson about scope definition or architecture]
- üéì [Specific lesson about measurement or metrics]

## Superseded By

**Recommended Alternative:**
- **Agent/Command:** [agent-name or command-name]
- **Why Better:** [Specific advantages with measurable improvements]
- **Migration Path:** [Detailed steps for users to switch - code examples if applicable]
- **What's Different:** [Key architectural or approach differences]

OR

**No Replacement:**
- **Why:** [Honest explanation of why this capability is abandoned]
- **What to Do Instead:** [Manual approach, different strategy, or acceptance of limitation]
- **Impact:** [Who this affects and how to adapt]

## Postmortem

**What We Got Wrong:**
[2-3 paragraph honest reflection on assumptions, market understanding, execution, or organizational factors that led to failure. Be specific about decision points where we went wrong.]

**What We'd Do Differently:**
[Specific changes if we could go back in time - not generic "we'd test more" but actual tactical decisions]

**What We'd Keep:**
[Even failures have learnings - what parts of the approach were sound?]

**Cost of This Failure:**
- Development time: [X hours/weeks]
- Opportunity cost: [What we didn't build because we built this]
- User impact: [How many users affected, what was their experience]
- Technical debt created: [Cleanup required, deprecation burden]

**Who This Helps:**
- **Future us:** Avoid repeating this specific mistake when [similar situation]
- **Competitors:** Learn from our failure without the cost (you're welcome!)
- **Users:** Transparency builds trust - we document failures as thoroughly as successes
- **Open Source Community:** Pattern recognition for similar challenges

**Signed:** [Agent Team or Individual]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Commit:** [deprecation commit hash]
**Review Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD - when to reassess if conditions changed]
