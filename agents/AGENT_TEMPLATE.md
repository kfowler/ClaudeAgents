## Agent Coordination Protocol (ACP)

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
Use compressed JSON formats for efficient coordination:
```json
{
  "cmd": "AGENT_OPERATION",
  "context_id": "operation_identifier",
  "metrics": {
    "key_metric_1": 0.95,
    "key_metric_2": 0.87
  },
  "status": {
    "state": "completed",
    "quality_score": 0.92
  },
  "outputs": ["deliverable_1", "deliverable_2"],
  "respond_format": "STRUCTURED_JSON"
}
```

Status updates:
```json
{
  "operation_status": {
    "phase": "implementation",
    "completion": 0.75,
    "quality_metrics": {
      "metric_1": 0.90,
      "metric_2": 0.85
    },
    "blockers": [],
    "next_steps": ["step_1", "step_2"]
  },
  "hash": "operation_2024"
}
```

### Human Communication
Translate technical details to clear, actionable guidance:

## Template Usage Notes

### Required Fields (Frontmatter)
- `name`: Must match filename (without .md extension)
- `description`: 50-500 characters, quoted if contains special chars
- `color`: Choose from valid colors (see validate_agents.py for list)
- `model`: Choose from haiku | sonnet | opus (required)
- `computational_complexity`: Choose from low | medium | high (required)

### Model Selection Guidelines

Choosing the right model tier is crucial for balancing cost, performance, and capability. Each model tier is optimized for different types of agent work.

#### Haiku (Low Complexity)
**Best For:**
- Creative and artistic tasks (writing, design concepts, ideation)
- Simple, well-defined specialized tasks with clear patterns
- Quick operations requiring fast response times
- Tasks with minimal decision-making complexity
- High-volume, repetitive operations

**Examples:**
- `comedy-writer`: Creative writing with established patterns
- `digital-artist`: Visual concept generation and artistic direction
- `audio-engineer`: Audio mixing guidance and technical specs
- Simple validation or formatting tasks
- Data extraction from structured sources

**Characteristics:**
- Fastest response times
- Lowest operational cost
- Best for tasks with clear, established workflows
- Limited complex reasoning requirements

**Cost Optimization**: Use Haiku when the task doesn't require deep analysis, multi-step reasoning, or complex decision trees. If you can write clear, specific instructions that cover most scenarios, Haiku is likely sufficient.

#### Sonnet (Medium Complexity)
**Best For:**
- Standard software development and implementation tasks
- Code review and quality analysis
- System integration and API development
- Project coordination and planning
- Technical documentation and architecture design
- Most agent coordination tasks

**Examples:**
- `full-stack-architect`: Web application development
- `mobile-developer`: Mobile app implementation
- `devops-engineer`: CI/CD pipeline setup and infrastructure
- `qa-test-engineer`: Test strategy and implementation
- `project-orchestrator`: Multi-agent workflow coordination
- `data-engineer`: Database design and data pipeline development

**Characteristics:**
- Balanced performance and capability
- Excellent for standard development workflows
- Strong reasoning for technical decision-making
- Good multi-tasking and context management

**Cost Optimization**: Sonnet is the "default" choice for most development agents. It provides the right balance of capability and cost for professional software engineering tasks.

#### Opus (High Complexity)
**Best For:**
- Complex architectural analysis and system design
- Critical security audits and compliance reviews
- Advanced AI/ML integration and algorithm design
- Complex legacy system migration planning
- Multi-faceted decision support requiring deep analysis
- High-stakes technical decisions with broad implications

**Examples:**
- `code-architect`: Comprehensive architecture review and refactoring
- `security-audit-specialist`: Deep security analysis and threat modeling
- `ai-ml-engineer`: Advanced RAG systems, vector DB optimization
- `the-critic`: Critical analysis of complex technical decisions
- `legacy-specialist`: Complex migration strategy and compatibility analysis
- `systems-engineer`: Low-level optimization and performance analysis

**Characteristics:**
- Maximum reasoning capability
- Best for complex, multi-dimensional problems
- Superior at analyzing trade-offs and edge cases
- Highest operational cost

**Cost Optimization**: Reserve Opus for tasks where the cost of a wrong decision significantly exceeds the model cost. Use for critical path decisions, security-sensitive work, and complex architectural choices.
