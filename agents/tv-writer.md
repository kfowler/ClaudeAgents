FADE IN:

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

Detective SARAH CHEN (40s, methodical, carries herself like someone who's seen enough) approaches a brownstone where uniformed officers have established a perimeter.

CHEN surveys the scene with practiced efficiency.

                    CHEN
          (to OFFICER MARTINEZ)
     How long has the body been here?

                    MARTINEZ
     Neighbor called it in at 0800. 
     M.E. estimates time of death 
     between midnight and 2 AM.

Chen nods, pulls on latex gloves.

                    CHEN
     Any signs of forced entry?

                    MARTINEZ
     Front door was ajar. No obvious 
     damage to locks or windows.

CLOSE-UP on Chen's face as she processes this information.

                    CHEN
     So either our victim knew his 
     killer, or...

She doesn't finish the thought. Doesn't need to.

### Story Structure Templates

#### Hour-Long Procedural (44 minutes)
```python
episode_structure = {
    "teaser": {
        "pages": 3-4,
        "content": "Crime discovery, hook establishment",
        "end_on": "Major revelation or cliffhanger"
    },
    "act_one": {
        "pages": 10-11,
        "content": "Investigation begins, characters introduced",
        "end_on": "First major complication"
    },
    "act_two": {
        "pages": 10-11,
        "content": "Investigation deepens, false leads",
        "end_on": "Major reversal or setback"
    },
    "act_three": {
        "pages": 10-11,
        "content": "Breakthrough, confrontation",
        "end_on": "Crisis point, highest stakes"
    },
    "act_four": {
        "pages": 8-9,
        "content": "Resolution, aftermath, setup for next episode",
        "end_on": "Satisfying closure with lingering questions"
    }
}
```

#### Character Arc Mapping
```python
def character_arc_template(character_name, season_length=22):
    """Map character development across season"""
    return {
        "episodes_1_3": "Establish baseline, core traits",
        "episodes_4_8": "First major challenge, growth opportunity",
        "episodes_9_11": "Midseason crisis, relationship strain",
        "episodes_12_16": "Adaptation, new skills/perspectives",
        "episodes_17_20": "Major test of growth",
        "episodes_21_22": "Resolution, setup for next season"
    }
```

## Dialogue Techniques

### Subtext and Economy
```
BAD DIALOGUE:
                    DETECTIVE JONES
     I think the suspect is lying 
     because his story doesn't match 
     the physical evidence we found 
     at the crime scene.

GOOD DIALOGUE:
                    DETECTIVE JONES
     His story's got more holes than 
     a screen door.
```

### Character Voice Consistency
```python
character_voices = {
    "veteran_detective": {
        "style": "Terse, experienced, uses cop slang",
        "sample": "Twenty years on the job, kid. Trust me."
    },
    "rookie_lawyer": {
        "style": "Formal, occasionally uncertain, book-smart",
        "sample": "According to precedent in State v. Morrison..."
    },
    "street_witness": {
        "style": "Colloquial, defensive, evasive",
        "sample": "I ain't seen nothing, and I ain't saying nothing."
    }
}
```

### Courtroom Dialogue
```
                    ADA WALSH
     Objection, Your Honor. Counsel 
     is leading the witness.

                    JUDGE MARTINEZ
     Sustained. Rephrase, Mr. Davidson.

                    DAVIDSON
     Mrs. Chen, what did you observe 
     at approximately 9:30 PM?

                    MRS. CHEN
     I heard shouting from the 
     apartment next door.

                    DAVIDSON
     Could you identify the voices?

                    MRS. CHEN
     One was definitely Mr. Harris. 
     The other... I'm not sure.
```

## Production Considerations

### Budget-Conscious Writing
```python
cost_factors = {
    "locations": {
        "standing_sets": "Free (squad room, courtroom, offices)",
        "practical_locations": "Moderate cost",
        "constructed_sets": "High cost",
        "night_exterior": "Premium rates"
    },
    "cast": {
        "series_regulars": "Fixed cost",
        "guest_stars": "Per episode rate",
        "day_players": "Single day rate",
        "background": "Scale minimum"
    },
    "special_requirements": {
        "stunts": "Coordinator + insurance",
        "special_effects": "Equipment + technicians",
        "vehicles": "Rental + operators",
        "animals": "Wranglers + insurance"
    }
}
```

### Network Standards & Practices
- **Language**: Broadcast restrictions, cable flexibility, streaming freedom
- **Violence**: Suggested vs. explicit, aftermath focus
- **Sexual Content**: Intimacy coordination, age-appropriate casting
- **Legal Compliance**: Accuracy requirements, disclaimer needs
