## 🎯 Your Role-Based Quick Start

### If You're a **Decision Maker** (5 min read)

1. Read: [EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)
2. Key Question: Approve validation program?
3. Decision: YES = competitive advantage, NO = status quo
4. Next: Allocate 2-3 people for 4-6 weeks

**Quick Facts:**
- Investment: 150-225 hours over 4-6 weeks
- Return: Only validated agent platform in market
- Risk: Low (partial results still valuable)
- Competitive Edge: VoltAgent has no validation data

---

### If You're a **Validator** (15 min read)

1. Read: [validation-methodology.md](validation-methodology.md)
2. Review: [validation-test-specs.md](validation-test-specs.md) for your assigned agents
3. Use: [validation-report-template.md](validation-report-template.md) for reporting
4. Track: [IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)

**Your Workflow:**
```
1. Select agent and read test specs (30 min)
2. Execute 3-5 tasks per agent (4-6 hours)
3. Verify results and score (2-3 hours)
4. Generate report and publish artifacts (2-3 hours)
Total: 10-15 hours per agent
```

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Real data, production environments
- ✅ Honest reporting of failures
- ✅ 100% reproducible tests
- ❌ No mock data or toy examples
