# React Performance Optimization - Problem Context

## Problem Statement

A React-based SaaS analytics dashboard is experiencing severe performance issues affecting user retention and satisfaction.

## Current State

**Application Profile:**
- **Technology Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Redux, Recharts, TanStack Table
- **User Base:** 10,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- **Team Size:** 4 full-time engineers (3 frontend, 1 backend)
- **Deployment:** AWS (CloudFront + S3 + API Gateway + Lambda)

**Performance Metrics (Current):**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** 4.2s (target: <2.5s)
- **First Input Delay (FID):** 280ms (target: <100ms)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0.31 (target: <0.1)
- **Bundle Size:** 2.8MB compressed (7.2MB uncompressed)
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** 5.8s on 4G connection
- **Page Load Time:** 6.5s average

**User Impact:**
- **Bounce Rate:** 42% (up from 28% six months ago)
- **Session Duration:** 3.2 minutes average (down from 5.8 minutes)
- **Support Tickets:** 23% mention "slow dashboard" or "loading issues"
- **Feature Adoption:** Low (<15% use advanced features, likely due to performance)

## Constraints

**Budget:**
- 2 developer-months total effort
- Cannot hire additional engineers
- Must use existing AWS infrastructure (no migration to new cloud provider)

**Timeline:**
- Q1 2026 launch target (12 weeks from now)
- Must ship incremental improvements every 2 weeks
- Cannot afford "big bang" rewrite

**Technical:**
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Cannot break existing user workflows or saved views
- React 18 required (company-wide standard)
- Must support IE11 (5% of enterprise customers still use it)

**Team:**
- Limited performance optimization experience
- No dedicated performance engineer
- Must balance with ongoing feature development (60% capacity for optimization)

## Success Criteria

**Primary Metrics (Must Achieve):**
- LCP <2.5s (improve from 4.2s)
- FID <100ms (improve from 280ms)
- CLS <0.1 (improve from 0.31)
- Bundle size <1.5MB compressed (reduce from 2.8MB)

**Secondary Metrics (Nice to Have):**
- TTI <3s on 4G
- Lighthouse Performance score >90 (currently 42)
- Reduce bounce rate to <30%
- Increase session duration to >5 minutes

**Business Impact:**
- Prevent 15% churn attributed to performance issues
- Enable launch of premium tier requiring fast performance
- Improve App Store rating from 3.2★ to >4.0★

## Key Questions

1. Where should we focus first for maximum ROI given limited time/budget?
2. How do we balance performance work with ongoing feature development?
3. Which optimizations can be shipped incrementally vs. requiring coordinated releases?
4. How do we prevent performance regression after initial improvements?
5. Can we achieve targets without major architectural changes?

## Desired Output

Use the creative triad workflow to:
1. **the-inventor**: Generate 7-12 diverse optimization approaches spanning different mechanisms, user experiences, and implementation complexities
2. **the-synthesist**: Organize ideas into 3-5 coherent strategic frames with clear tradeoffs
3. **the-architect-of-experiments**: Design 2-3 falsifiable experiments (48-120 hours each) to validate top approaches before full implementation

**Diversity Goal:** Ensure ideas span:
- **Mechanisms:** Code-level optimization, architectural changes, infrastructure improvements, UX changes
- **Experiences:** Perceived vs. actual performance, progressive enhancement, graceful degradation
- **Markets:** Power users vs. casual users, enterprise vs. SMB, desktop vs. mobile
- **Data Approaches:** Client-side caching, server-side optimization, CDN strategies, lazy loading
