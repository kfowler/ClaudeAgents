# Examples and Design Specifications

This directory contains proof-of-concept implementations and design specifications for potential future features.

## Contents

### `IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLE.py`
**Status:** Design Specification / Proof of Concept
**Purpose:** Demonstrates how machine learning could enhance agent recommendations in future versions.

This file is not integrated with the main system. It serves as a design reference for potential AI-enhanced agent selection using embeddings and semantic similarity.

### `analysis/`
**Status:** Design Specification / Prototype
**Purpose:** Comprehensive project analysis system with intelligent agent recommendations.

This directory contains a sophisticated project analysis framework that was designed to:
- Automatically detect technology stacks, frameworks, and project types
- Analyze project complexity, architecture patterns, and quality metrics
- Provide intelligent agent recommendations based on project context
- Cache analysis results for performance

**Why it's here:** The analysis system requires ML dependencies (numpy, scikit-learn, sentence-transformers) and the `project_analyzer.py` module is not yet implemented. Rather than leaving incomplete code in the main tools/ directory, it's preserved here as a design reference.

**Future Integration:** If ML-based agent selection becomes a priority, this code provides an excellent foundation. The architecture is well-designed and aligns with the agent recommendation patterns.

## Using These Examples

These files are:
- ✅ Safe to read and study for design patterns
- ✅ Useful as reference implementations
- ❌ Not ready for production use
- ❌ Not tested or maintained as part of the core system

If you want to experiment with these features:

```bash
# For ML-based selection
pip install numpy scikit-learn sentence-transformers

# Note: You'll need to implement missing modules referenced in the code
```

## Contributing

If you'd like to complete these implementations:
1. Review the design in these files
2. Implement missing dependencies
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Submit a PR with the complete, working system

Incomplete implementations should remain in `examples/` until they're production-ready.
