# Test Coverage Analysis & Implementation

Analyze and improve test coverage for the project:

**Coverage Analysis:**
- Generate current test coverage report
- Identify uncovered code paths and critical gaps
- Analyze test quality and effectiveness

**Test Implementation:**
- Write comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
- Add integration tests for key workflows
- Create edge case and error condition tests
- Implement property-based or fuzz testing where appropriate

**Test Strategy:**
- Suggest testing frameworks and tools if not already established
- Recommend mocking strategies for external dependencies
- Design test data management approach
- Establish continuous testing practices

**Quality Metrics:**
- Set realistic coverage targets
- Focus on business-critical code paths
- Balance test coverage with maintenance overhead
- Implement test performance monitoring
