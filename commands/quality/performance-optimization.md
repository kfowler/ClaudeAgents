# Performance Optimization Workflow

**Command:** `/performance-optimization`
**Agents:** `frontend-performance-specialist`, `seo-performance-specialist`, `full-stack-architect`, `data-engineer`, `devops-engineer`
**Complexity:** High
**Duration:** 8-12 hours

## Overview

Comprehensive performance optimization workflow that coordinates five specialized agents to deliver systematic improvements across all application layers—from frontend rendering to database queries to infrastructure costs—with measurable business impact and ROI.

## What This Command Does

This command orchestrates a complete performance optimization across 8 phases:

### Phase 1: Performance Baseline & Profiling (1-2 hours)
**Lead:** `frontend-performance-specialist`

- Establish comprehensive baseline metrics across all layers
- Core Web Vitals assessment (LCP, FID, CLS)
- API response time profiling (p50, p95, p99)
- Database query performance analysis
- Infrastructure utilization and cost analysis
- User experience impact correlation

**Deliverables:**
- Performance baseline report with current metrics
- Bottleneck priority matrix (CRITICAL → LOW)
- Performance score dashboard (0-100 scale)
- Business impact correlation (bounce rate, conversion)

### Phase 2: Frontend Optimization (2-3 hours)
**Lead:** `frontend-performance-specialist`

- Bundle optimization and code splitting (route-based, component-based)

- Resource loading strategy (preload, prefetch, service worker)
- Core Web Vitals specific fixes (LCP, FID, CLS)

**Expected Improvements:**
- Bundle size reduced 50-70% (e.g., 612KB → 140KB)
- Core Web Vitals in "Good" range (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)
- Page load time reduced 40-60% (e.g., 6.8s → 2.1s on 4G)

## Notes

**Multi-Agent Coordination:** This workflow requires coordination between 5 specialists. The `frontend-performance-specialist` acts as lead coordinator for phase transitions and final reporting.

**Incremental Deployment:** While comprehensive (8-12 hours), optimizations should be deployed incrementally and validated. Each phase is independently deployable.

**Production Safety:** All optimizations tested in staging before production. Load/stress testing validates stability. Feature flags enable gradual rollout and quick rollback.

**Performance Culture:** Success depends on establishing sustainable performance engineering culture. Includes Performance Champions program, performance budgets in CI/CD, and ongoing monitoring.

**Business Alignment:** Emphasizes ROI, conversion impact, and cost savings. Typical results: $600K-$2M annual revenue impact, 35% cost reduction, 10-17x ROI first year.

**Continuous Improvement:** Establishes foundation for ongoing performance engineering with monitoring, alerting, budgets, and quarterly optimization cycles.

**Timeline:** Can be executed as focused 1-2 day sprint or distributed across 2 weeks with validation between phases. Most teams complete in 3-4 dedicated days.
