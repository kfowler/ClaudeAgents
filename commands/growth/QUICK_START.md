# Growth Commands - Quick Start Guide

## What Are Growth Commands?

5 specialized commands that help you grow your product by optimizing conversion, retention, viral loops, metrics, and experimentation. Each command takes 20-35 minutes and delivers actionable strategies using AI agent orchestration.

## Available Commands

### 1. Landing Page Optimization
```bash
/growth:conversion-audit
```
**When to use:** Your landing page isn't converting visitors into users
**What you get:** Performance audit, funnel analysis, A/B test specs, implementation roadmap
**Expected impact:** 15-30% conversion improvement

### 2. Referral Program Design
```bash
/growth:viral-loop
```
**When to use:** Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is too high, need organic growth
**What you get:** Viral mechanics design, incentive structure, technical architecture, K-factor modeling
**Expected impact:** 50-80% CAC reduction through referrals

### 3. User Retention Optimization
```bash
/growth:retention-playbook
```
**When to use:** High churn rate, low user engagement, retention below benchmarks
**What you get:** Onboarding redesign, engagement loops, churn prediction, win-back campaigns
**Expected impact:** 10+ percentage point retention improvement = 2-3x LTV increase

### 4. Analytics Infrastructure
```bash
/growth:metrics-setup
```
**When to use:** Need data-driven decision making, preparing to scale, missing analytics
**What you get:** North Star metric, analytics architecture, dashboards, measurement framework
**Expected impact:** Foundation for all other growth initiatives

### 5. A/B Testing Strategy
```bash
/growth:experiment-design
```
**When to use:** Ready to systematically test growth ideas (need 1K+ weekly active users)
**What you get:** 30-50 experiment hypotheses, prioritized A/B tests, statistical design, learning system
**Expected impact:** 2-5x ROI vs ad-hoc optimization

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your Command

Pick based on your biggest growth challenge:
- **Low conversion?** → `/growth:conversion-audit`
- **High CAC?** → `/growth:viral-loop`
- **Users churning?** → `/growth:retention-playbook`
- **No data?** → `/growth:metrics-setup`
- **Ready to optimize?** → `/growth:experiment-design`

### Step 2: Prepare Prerequisites

Each command needs different inputs. Check the command's "Prerequisites" section:

**Example (Conversion Audit):**
- Landing page URL (live or staging)
- Current conversion rate (if known)
- Analytics access (Google Analytics, etc.)
- Target audience definition

### Step 3: Run the Command

Simply invoke the command - the AI will orchestrate multiple specialized agents:

```bash
/growth:conversion-audit
```

**What happens:**
1. **Phase 1:** Technical performance analysis (5-7 min)
2. **Phase 2:** Funnel analysis (8-10 min)
3. **Phase 3:** A/B testing strategy (5-8 min)
4. **Phase 4:** Implementation roadmap (5-7 min)

**Total time:** 20-30 minutes

### Step 4: Review Deliverables

You'll receive actionable outputs:
- Technical reports with metrics
- Prioritized recommendations
- Implementation specifications
- Roadmaps with timelines
- Success criteria and KPIs

### Step 5: Implement & Measure

Each command provides clear next steps. Implement the quick wins first, then tackle strategic initiatives.

## FAQ

**Q: Which command should I start with?**
A: Start with `/growth:metrics-setup` if you don't have analytics. Otherwise, pick the command addressing your biggest growth bottleneck.

**Q: Do I need all 5 commands?**
A: No. Use what you need. Most teams use 2-3 commands relevant to their stage.

**Q: How long do these take?**
A: 20-35 minutes per command. Plan for 30 minutes to be safe.

**Q: Can I run multiple commands in sequence?**
A: Yes! Common pattern: metrics → retention → conversion → experiments.

**Q: Do I need technical skills?**
A: No. Commands provide analysis and recommendations. Implementation may need developers, but understanding outputs doesn't.

**Q: What if my traffic is too low?**
A: Conversion audit and metrics setup work at any scale. Viral loop and retention need 100+ users. Experiments need 1K+ weekly active users.

**Q: Are these commands free?**
A: Commands are part of the Claude Code agent ecosystem. They orchestrate existing agents at no additional cost.

**Q: Will there be a dedicated growth agent?**
A: Maybe! We're validating demand with these commands first. If usage is strong (20+ invocations, 10+ users, 70%+ completion), we'll build a dedicated growth agent.

## Success Stories We Want to Hear

After using growth commands, share outcomes like:
- "Conversion audit identified 3 quick wins → 22% signup increase"

- "Retention playbook increased D30 retention from 18% to 31%"
- "Metrics setup gave us our North Star metric"
- "Experiment design helped us ship 12 validated tests"

These outcomes validate the value and inform future development.
