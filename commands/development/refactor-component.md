# Component Refactoring

Refactor the specified component or module to improve:

**Code Structure:**
- Break down large functions/classes into smaller, focused units
- Improve separation of concerns
- Apply appropriate design patterns
- Reduce coupling and increase cohesion

**Maintainability:**
- Improve naming conventions and clarity
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Enhance error handling
- Increase testability

**Process:**
1. Analyze current structure and identify issues
2. Propose new architecture with clear rationale
3. Implement changes incrementally
4. Ensure all tests pass after each step
5. Update documentation and tests as needed

**Verification:**
- Maintain existing functionality (no breaking changes)
- Improve performance where possible
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Add missing test coverage
