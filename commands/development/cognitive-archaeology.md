# Cognitive Code Archaeology

**Command:** `/development:cognitive-archaeology`

**Agents:** `llm-integration-architect`, `data-engineer`, `technical-writer`

**Complexity:** High

**Duration:** 2-4 hours (first run), 30 seconds (subsequent queries)

---

## What This Command Does

Analyzes your repository's complete history to answer "why" questions about code decisions using natural language queries. Combines git commit history, GitHub PR discussions, and issue context to provide intelligent answers with citations.

This is a **breakthrough feature** unique to ClaudeAgents - no other platform offers multi-source code archaeology with natural language queries.

---

## When to Use This

Use cognitive archaeology when you need to:
- **Understand legacy code**: "Why was this architecture chosen?"
- **Onboard new team members**: "What were the key design decisions?"
- **Investigate technical debt**: "Why was this workaround implemented?"
- **Recover lost context**: "What problem did this solve?"
- **Document decisions**: "When was authentication first added and why?"

---

## What You Get

1. **Interactive Query System**:
   - Ask questions in natural language
   - Get intelligent answers with confidence scores
   - View citations linking to actual commits/PRs
   - Follow-up questions for deeper understanding

2. **Multi-Source Analysis**:
   - Git commit history (messages, diffs, authors)
   - GitHub PR discussions (if available)
   - Issue references and context
   - Temporal correlation across sources

3. **Export Capabilities**:
   - Markdown export of query history
   - Citation preservation
   - Documentation-ready output

---

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis (one-time setup)

The system analyzes your repository:
1. **Git History**: Extracts commits, identifies architectural changes
2. **GitHub Integration** (optional): Enriches with PR/issue context
3. **Semantic Indexing**: Builds searchable index of all decisions
4. **Performance**: ~10 seconds per 100 commits

### Phase 2: Interactive Queries (instant)

Ask questions and get answers:
1. **Natural Language**: Type questions in plain English
2. **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant commits/discussions
3. **Answer Synthesis**: Generates coherent answers with citations
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Shows answer reliability (0-100%)

‚ùì Question: Why was authentication refactored in Q2 2024?

Answer:
Based on repository history analysis:

The authentication system was refactored to address security
vulnerabilities discovered during a security audit. The main
changes included:

1. Switching from custom JWT implementation to industry-standard
   library (commit a3f2c1d by jane.smith, 2024-04-15)
2. Adding refresh token rotation (commit b4e8d2a)
3. Implementing rate limiting on auth endpoints (commit c9f1e3b)

These changes were discussed in PR #156 where the team agreed
the custom implementation had multiple issues including:
- No token rotation
- Weak signature validation
- Missing rate limiting

Confidence: 85% | Credibility: 92%

## Example Questions

**Architecture Decisions:**
- "Why did we choose microservices over monolith?"
- "What was the rationale for using PostgreSQL?"
- "Why did we adopt GraphQL instead of REST?"

**Technical Debt:**
- "Why was this workaround implemented in auth.py?"
- "What was the original purpose of the legacy/ directory?"
- "Why do we have two different caching implementations?"

**Feature Evolution:**
- "When was real-time collaboration first added?"
- "How did the API versioning strategy evolve?"
- "What led to the current database schema design?"

**Team Context:**
- "Who made the key architecture decisions?"
- "What were the main concerns during the Q3 redesign?"
- "Why was the mobile app rewritten in 2024?"

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Legacy Code Investigation

**Question**: "Why does the payment processing use a custom retry mechanism?"

**Answer**: Investigation revealed commit 7a3b2f1 from 2022 where the team
implemented custom retry logic because Stripe's webhook deliveries were
unreliable. PR discussion shows they considered using a queue but chose
inline retries for simplicity. This context helps inform a modern
refactoring to use a proper job queue.

**Value**: Avoided removing "defensive code" that was solving a real problem.

### Example 2: Onboarding New Developer

**Question**: "What's the overall architecture of the authentication system?"

**Answer**: System traced evolution through 12 commits, showing progression
from basic session-based auth ‚Üí JWT ‚Üí OAuth2. Citations linked to original
design docs in PR descriptions. New developer understood the "why" behind
current implementation in 10 minutes vs. days of code reading.

**Value**: 20x faster onboarding on critical system.

### Example 3: Technical Debt Justification

**Question**: "Why do we have technical debt in the analytics module?"

**Answer**: Found 8 commits showing analytics was rushed for product launch
deadline. Team explicitly documented shortcuts taken and why they were
acceptable. This context justified prioritizing refactoring in Q3 roadmap.

**Value**: Data-driven technical debt prioritization.

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Onboarding Automation

```bash
# Generate onboarding guide
/development:cognitive-archaeology --query "
What are the top 10 most important architecture decisions?
" --export docs/architecture-decisions.md
```

### Pattern 2: Documentation Generation

```bash
# Document key decisions for each module
for module in auth api database; do
  /development:cognitive-archaeology --query "
  What were the key design decisions for $module?
  " --path="src/$module/" --export "docs/$module-decisions.md"
done
```

### Pattern 3: Technical Debt Analysis

```bash
# Find and document all known workarounds
/development:cognitive-archaeology --query "
Find all commits mentioning TODO, FIXME, or workaround.
Why were these shortcuts taken?
" --export docs/technical-debt-context.md
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Not a git repository"
**Solution**: Ensure you're in a git repository: `git status`

**Issue**: GitHub enrichment fails
**Solution**: Set GITHUB_TOKEN: `export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token"`

**Issue**: Analysis is slow
**Solution**: Limit commits: `--limit=100` or install FAISS: `pip install faiss-cpu`
