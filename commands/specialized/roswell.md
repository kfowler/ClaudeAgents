# Roswell Common Lisp Development Environment

Manage your Common Lisp development with Roswell and SBCL:

**Roswell Environment Management:**
- Install and switch between different Lisp implementations (SBCL, CCL, ECL)
- Manage Quicklisp installations and local projects
- Install and update Roswell scripts and utilities
- Configure implementation-specific optimizations

**SBCL Development Workflow:**
- Start SBCL with project-specific configurations
- Load systems via ASDF and manage dependencies
- Profile code performance and memory allocation
- Debug compilation warnings and optimize declarations

**Package & System Management:**
- Create new ASDF system definitions
- Manage Quicklisp dependencies and local overrides
- Test package compatibility across Lisp implementations
- Handle package exports and symbol conflicts

**REPL-Driven Development:**
- Live code modification and hot-swapping functions
- Interactive debugging with the SBCL debugger
- Trace function calls and analyze execution flow
- Test macro expansions and compile-time computation

**Integration with Other Tools:**
- Connect Lisp REPL to running web servers or services
- Interface with PostgreSQL through postmodern or cl-dbi
- Call out to system commands and shell scripts
- Interface with C libraries via CFFI

**Deployment & Distribution:**
- Build standalone executables with Roswell
- Create Docker images with Lisp applications
- Deploy to pi server with appropriate startup scripts
- Package systems for distribution via Quicklisp
