# Lisp Macro Development Workshop

Advanced Common Lisp macro development and metaprogramming:

**Macro Design & Development:**
- Design domain-specific languages and syntax extensions
- Debug macro expansion and hygiene issues
- Test macros across different use cases and edge conditions
- Optimize macro performance and compile-time computation

**Advanced Metaprogramming:**
- Generate code based on external data sources or APIs
- Create compile-time computations and optimizations
- Build code transformation and analysis tools
- Implement custom control structures and language extensions

**Macro Debugging & Analysis:**
- Trace macro expansion steps interactively
- Analyze generated code for correctness and efficiency
- Debug symbol capture and variable hygiene issues
- Test macro behavior across different compilation contexts

**Integration with Modern Lisp:**
- Use macros with CLOS and generic functions
- Integrate with package systems and module structures
- Handle reader macros and custom syntax
- Work with condition systems and error handling

**Code Generation Patterns:**
- Template-based code generation with backquote
- Recursive macro expansion for nested structures
- Conditional compilation based on features
- Cross-platform code generation and compatibility

**Performance Optimization:**
- Macro expansion caching and memoization
- Compile-time vs runtime computation trade-offs
- Memory-efficient macro expansion strategies
- Integration with SBCL's advanced compiler features

**Real-World Applications:**
- Web framework DSLs and routing macros
- Database query builders and ORM layers
- Configuration and deployment automation
- API client generation from specifications
