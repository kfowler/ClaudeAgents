# Product Roadmap Planning

**Command:** `/product-roadmap`
**Agents:** `product-manager`, `business-analyst`, `product-strategist`
**Complexity:** Medium-High
**Duration:** 6-10 hours (depending on scope)

## Overview

Performs comprehensive product roadmap planning, prioritizing features, defining OKRs, creating strategic roadmaps, and aligning product vision with business objectives for successful product execution.

## What This Command Does

This command orchestrates a complete product roadmap workflow across three specialized agents:

1. **Feature Prioritization** (`product-manager`)
   - Feature discovery and evaluation
   - Prioritization frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, Kano, Weighted Scoring)
   - Effort vs. impact analysis
   - Dependency mapping
   - Release planning

2. **Business Alignment** (`business-analyst`)
   - Business value assessment
   - Stakeholder requirements mapping
   - ROI analysis
   - Risk assessment
   - Success metrics definition

3. **Strategic Vision** (`product-strategist`)
   - Market opportunity validation
   - Competitive positioning
   - Product-market fit analysis
   - Strategic themes and initiatives
   - Long-term vision alignment

## Usage

```bash
# Create product roadmap from scratch
/product-roadmap --product="CRM Platform" --timeframe="12 months"

# Update existing roadmap
/product-roadmap --roadmap=current-roadmap.md --update

# Quarterly planning
/product-roadmap --quarter=Q4-2024 --focus="Growth initiatives"

# Feature backlog prioritization
/product-roadmap --backlog=features.csv --prioritize
```

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Feature Discovery (60-90 min)

**product-manager** gathers and categorizes features:

**Feature Sources:**
1. **Customer Feedback:**

   - NPS feedback and churn analysis
   - Sales team input (lost deals)

2. **Market Research:**
   - Competitor analysis
   - Industry trends
   - Analyst reports
   - Beta feedback

3. **Internal Ideas:**
   - Product team brainstorming
   - Engineering suggestions
   - Executive vision
   - Technical debt

4. **Data-Driven:**
   - Usage analytics
   - A/B test results
   - Funnel analysis
   - Retention metrics

**Example Output:**
```

- **Confidence:** How confident in estimates (0-100%)?
- **Effort:** How many person-months required?
- **RICE Score:** (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

**Example Output:**

**Example Output:**
```
Roadmap Risk Assessment
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HIGH RISKS (Require Mitigation)

Risk 1: Mobile App Timeline at Risk
- Probability: 60%
- Impact: High (delays Q4 OKRs)
- Root Cause: Small team (2 engineers), aggressive timeline
- Mitigation:
  * Hire contractor for Android app (reduce by 4 weeks)
  * Reduce scope to MVP (defer offline mode to v2.2)
  * Parallel iOS/Android development (different engineers)
- Contingency: Delay Android to Q1 2025 if needed
- Owner: Engineering Manager

Risk 2: AI Feature Accuracy Below Expectations
- Probability: 40%
- Impact: High (differentiation opportunity, high visibility)
- Root Cause: ML model complexity, data quality, new territory
- Mitigation:
  * Extended beta period (8 weeks vs. standard 6)
  * Partner with ML consultant for model validation
  * Set realistic accuracy targets (80% vs. 95%)
  * Provide manual override for all AI recommendations
- Contingency: Launch as "experimental" feature, iterate based on feedback
- Owner: Product Manager

Risk 3: Real-time Collaboration Performance Issues
- Probability: 50%
- Impact: Medium (affects enterprise perception)
- Root Cause: Complex sync algorithm, high concurrency load
- Mitigation:
  * Proof of concept with operational transforms library
  * Load testing with 100+ concurrent users
  * Staged rollout (10% → 50% → 100% of users)
  * Fallback to polling-based sync if WebSocket fails
- Contingency: Reduce concurrent user limit (25 → 10) if needed
- Owner: Engineering Lead

MEDIUM RISKS (Monitor Closely)

Risk 4: SSO Adoption Lower Than Expected
- Probability: 30%
- Impact: Medium (Q3 OKR at risk)
- Root Cause: Enterprise IT delays, change management
- Mitigation:
  * White-glove onboarding for top 20 enterprise accounts
  * SSO setup documentation and videos
  * Incentive: Free month for SSO setup in Q3
- Owner: Product Manager

Risk 5: Integration Marketplace Lacks Developer Interest
- Probability: 35%
- Impact: Medium (Q2 2025 ecosystem strategy)
- Root Cause: Small developer ecosystem, limited incentives
- Mitigation:
  * Revenue share: 70/30 split (developer/company)
  * Developer grants: $5K for first 10 integrations
  * Case studies and marketing support
  * Partner with popular SaaS tools directly
- Owner: Head of Product

LOW RISKS (Accept)

Risk 6: Mobile App Store Approval Delays
- Probability: 20%
- Impact: Low (1-2 week delay acceptable)
- Mitigation: Submit 2 weeks early, address feedback quickly
- Owner: Product Manager

Risk 7: Customer Feature Priorities Shift
- Probability: 25%
- Impact: Low (roadmap flexibility built in)
- Mitigation: Quarterly roadmap reviews, continuous customer feedback
- Owner: Head of Product
```

2. **Ruthless Prioritization:** Say "no" to focus on high-impact features
3. **Quarterly Reviews:** Roadmaps are living documents, update regularly
4. **Communicate Trade-offs:** Explain why features are deferred
5. **Set Realistic Timelines:** Under-promise, over-deliver
6. **Measure Impact:** Track adoption and business metrics post-launch
7. **Balance Short/Long-term:** Quick wins + strategic bets
8. **Leave Buffer:** Plan for 80% capacity (20% for unplanned work)

**Pro Tip**: Use "Now-Next-Later" format for external roadmaps (customers, prospects) and detailed quarter-by-quarter timelines for internal planning (engineering, exec). This provides transparency while maintaining flexibility.
