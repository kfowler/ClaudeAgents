# Multi-AI Agent Consultation

Consult with different AI agents for diverse perspectives and specialized capabilities:

**Agent Orchestration:**
- Route questions to the most appropriate AI model
- Compare responses from multiple agents on complex problems
- Synthesize different AI perspectives into actionable insights
- Handle model-specific strengths (coding, analysis, creativity)

**Specialized Consultations:**
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Complex reasoning, mathematical problems, detailed analysis
- **Google Gemini**: Multimodal tasks, code generation, research synthesis
- **Anthropic Claude**: Ethical reasoning, code review, technical writing
- **Local Models**: Privacy-sensitive tasks, offline development

**Cross-Agent Workflows:**
- Have one agent generate code, another review it
- Use different agents for different languages or frameworks
- Compare architectural decisions across multiple AI perspectives
- Validate critical logic with multiple independent analyses

**Context Management:**
- Share relevant context between different AI consultations
- Maintain conversation threads across multiple agents
- Aggregate insights and track decision rationales
- Document which agent provided which recommendations

**Integration Patterns:**
- Chain agent responses for complex multi-step problems
- Use agents for different phases (design, implementation, testing, review)
- Route based on expertise (functional vs OOP, frontend vs backend)
- Fallback to alternative agents when primary is unavailable

**API Management:**
- Handle rate limits and token usage across multiple services
- Manage API keys and authentication for different providers
- Monitor costs and usage patterns across agents
- Implement retry logic and error handling
