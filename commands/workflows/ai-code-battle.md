# AI Code Battle Arena

Pit different AI coding agents against each other for complex problems:

**Challenge Setup:**
- Define coding challenges with clear specifications and constraints
- Set up evaluation criteria (performance, readability, correctness, creativity)
- Establish test cases and benchmarks for objective comparison
- Create rubrics for subjective evaluation aspects

**Multi-Agent Competition:**
- Submit same problem to Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and local models
- Compare different approaches and algorithmic choices
- Evaluate code quality, documentation, and maintainability
- Test edge cases and error handling across solutions

**Specialized Battles:**
- **Performance Battle**: Optimize algorithms for speed and memory usage
- **Elegance Battle**: Most readable and maintainable solution
- **Creativity Battle**: Most innovative or unexpected approach
- **Robustness Battle**: Best error handling and edge case coverage

**Language-Specific Competitions:**
- Functional programming challenges (Haskell, F#, Lisp)
- Systems programming tasks (Rust, C/C++)
- Web development scenarios (TypeScript, Swift for backend)
- Cross-language interop challenges

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Database optimization problems using PostgreSQL
- Container orchestration challenges with OrbStack
- Deployment automation for dokku on pi
- Network programming and protocol implementation

**Analysis & Learning:**
- Identify patterns in how different AIs approach problems
- Learn new techniques and algorithms from AI solutions
- Discover language features and libraries you weren't aware of
- Build a knowledge base of best practices from multiple sources

**Meta-Programming Challenges:**
- Lisp macro writing competitions
- Code generation and template challenges
- DSL design and implementation contests
- Compiler optimization problems
