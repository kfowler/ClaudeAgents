# Python Web API Development

Build high-performance web APIs and services with modern Python:

**FastAPI Development:**
- Create async APIs with automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Implement request/response models with Pydantic validation
- Handle authentication (JWT, OAuth2, API keys)
- Set up middleware for CORS, logging, and request processing

**Database Integration:**
- Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support for PostgreSQL
- Implement database migrations with Alembic
- Handle connection pooling and transaction management
- Create repository patterns and database abstraction layers

**API Design Patterns:**
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes
- GraphQL APIs with Strawberry or Graphene
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Background task processing with Celery or asyncio

**Performance Optimization:**
- Async/await patterns for I/O-bound operations
- Database query optimization and N+1 problem prevention
- Caching strategies with Redis or in-memory caching
- Response compression and content negotiation

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for business logic and data models
- Integration tests for API endpoints with test database
- Load testing with locust or httpx for performance validation
- Mock external dependencies and services

**Security Implementation:**
- Input validation and sanitization with Pydantic
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Security headers and HTTPS enforcement

**Deployment & Containerization:**
- Create optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds
- Configure Gunicorn/Uvicorn for production deployment
- Deploy to pi server via dokku with health checks
- Handle environment configuration and secrets management

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics collection with Prometheus integration
- Error tracking and alerting systems
- Request tracing and performance monitoring

**Documentation & API Design:**
- Automatic OpenAPI schema generation
- Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI
- API versioning strategies and backward compatibility
- Client SDK generation for different languages

**Integration Patterns:**
- Connect to existing services and databases
- Implement event-driven architecture with message queues
- Handle file uploads and processing
- Third-party API integration and webhook handling

**Development Workflow:**
- Hot reloading for rapid development
- Database seeding and test data management
- API client testing and validation
- CI/CD pipeline integration

**Advanced Features:**
- Server-sent events for real-time updates
- WebSocket connections for bidirectional communication
- Background job processing and task queues
- File streaming and large payload handling
