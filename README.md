## 🔍 Agent Selection Guide

The system uses intelligent agent selection based on:
- **Keywords**: Technology mentions (React, Python, database, etc.)
- **Task Type**: Development, testing, deployment, analysis
- **Complexity**: Single agent vs multi-agent orchestration
- **Domain**: Web, mobile, AI/ML, infrastructure, etc.

Agent selection is based on keyword analysis, task type, and domain expertise.

## 🛠️ Tools & Utilities

### Installation
```bash
# Install required dependencies for validation tools
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

### Agent Validation
```bash
python3 tools/validate_agents.py
```
Validates all agent definitions for consistency and completeness.

### Examples and Prototypes
The `examples/` directory contains design specifications and proof-of-concept implementations:
- **Project analysis system**: Prototype for ML-based agent recommendations
- **Implementation examples**: Design patterns for future features

*Note: These are not production-ready. See examples/README.md for details.*

## 📚 Documentation

- **[The Manifesto](The-Claude-Code-Agent-Manifesto.md)** - Professional principles and engineering standards
- **[Project Instructions](CLAUDE.md)** - Guidance for Claude Code when working with this repository
- **[TODO Roadmap](TODO.md)** - Prioritized improvements and development roadmap

*Note: Comprehensive documentation in `docs/` directory is planned (see TODO.md for details)*

## 🏆 Success Metrics

Track agent effectiveness through:
- **Feature Completion Rate**: Delivered features working as specified
- **Code Quality Scores**: Maintainability, security, performance
- **Integration Success**: Seamless agent handoffs
- **Development Velocity**: Time from concept to production

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Review available agents** in the `agents/` directory
2. **Check commands** in `commands/` for pre-built workflows
3. **Read The Manifesto** to understand professional standards
4. **Use validation tools** in `tools/` to ensure consistency
