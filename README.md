# Specialized AI Agents for Claude Code

This directory contains 20 specialized AI agent definitions optimized for comprehensive software development projects. Each agent is an expert in their domain and works autonomously to deliver production-ready solutions.

## How Agents Work

Agents are intelligent, autonomous specialists that:
- Analyze requirements and create realistic execution plans
- Perform complex multi-step tasks with appropriate trade-off awareness
- Utilize all available tools while acknowledging limitations
- Coordinate with other agents through clear handoffs
- Deliver maintainable solutions with documentation

- **`code-reviewer`** - Code quality assessment, best practices enforcement

## üöÄ USAGE PATTERNS

### **üéØ Start Here for Different Project Types:**

**Building a Web Application:**
1. `product-strategist` ‚Üí Market validation & feature definition
2. `full-stack-architect` ‚Üí Complete web app implementation
3. `security-audit-specialist` ‚Üí Security review
4. `qa-test-engineer` ‚Üí Testing implementation

**Mobile App Development:**
1. `product-strategist` ‚Üí Market research & user personas
2. `mobile-developer` ‚Üí iOS/Android implementation
3. `accessibility-expert` ‚Üí Inclusive design review
4. `devops-engineer` ‚Üí App store deployment

**Adding AI Features:**
1. `ai-ml-engineer` ‚Üí LLM/RAG implementation
2. `data-engineer` ‚Üí Vector database & data pipelines
3. `security-audit-specialist` ‚Üí AI security review
4. `devops-engineer` ‚Üí ML infrastructure deployment

**Legacy System Modernization:**
1. `legacy-specialist` ‚Üí Migration strategy & compatibility
2. `code-architect` ‚Üí Architecture assessment & refactoring
3. `systems-engineer` ‚Üí Performance optimization
4. `qa-test-engineer` ‚Üí Comprehensive testing strategy

### **üîÑ Agent Coordination Patterns:**

**Sequential Execution:**
```
product-strategist ‚Üí project-orchestrator ‚Üí [development agents] ‚Üí qa-test-engineer
```

**Parallel Execution:**
```
full-stack-architect + security-audit-specialist + accessibility-expert
```

**Iterative Refinement:**
```
code-architect ‚Üí systems-engineer ‚Üí the-critic ‚Üí [refinement cycle]
```

## üìã AGENT INVOCATION

### **Automatic Selection (Recommended):**
Claude Code analyzes your request and selects optimal agents automatically based on:
- Task complexity and domain requirements
- Technology stack and platform targets
- Quality and security considerations
- Project phase and deliverable needs

### **Explicit Agent Requests:**
```
"Use the product-strategist to research the productivity software market"
"Have the ai-ml-engineer implement semantic search with RAG"
"Get the security-audit-specialist to review my authentication system"
"Ask the-critic to evaluate these architecture options"
```

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration:**
```
"Use the project-orchestrator to plan a task management app with:
- React frontend and Node.js backend
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile companion app
- AI-powered task suggestions"
```

## üéØ OPTIMAL USAGE TIPS

### **‚úÖ DO:**
- Start with `product-strategist` for new product ideas
- Use `project-orchestrator` for complex multi-domain projects
- Combine complementary agents (e.g., `full-stack-architect` + `accessibility-expert`)
- Leverage `the-critic` for important architectural decisions
- Include `security-audit-specialist` and `qa-test-engineer` in production code

### **‚ùå AVOID:**
- Using multiple agents with overlapping capabilities simultaneously
- Skipping security and accessibility reviews for production applications
- Implementing AI features without involving `ai-ml-engineer`
- Starting complex projects without product strategy validation
- Ignoring `code-architect` feedback on maintainability concerns
