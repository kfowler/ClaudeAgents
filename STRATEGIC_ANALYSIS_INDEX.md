## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why 10 weeks? Can we go faster?
**A:** With 2 engineers working in parallel, timeline reduces to 6-7 weeks. Critical path is MCP protocol (3-5 weeks) which can't be compressed much without risk.

### Q: What's the absolute minimum we need?
**A:** MCP protocol (3-5 weeks) + Quality certification (3.5-5 weeks). These two features alone position us competitively. Total: 6.5-10 weeks sequential, or 5-6 weeks with 2 engineers.

### Q: Why not just add more agents to match VoltAgent's 100+?
**A:** Quality over quantity is our strategic positioning. Without quality certification to prove it, we lose that advantage. Better to have 43 certified agents than 100+ unvetted.

### Q: Can we skip MCP protocol?
**A:** High risk. MCP is becoming industry standard. Claude Flow already has it, Anthropic is pushing it. Skipping means falling behind on critical integration capability.

### Q: What happens if we do nothing?
**A:** Competitive position erodes over time. VoltAgent captures "most comprehensive" positioning. MCP becomes standard without us. Risk of obsolescence in 6-12 months.

### Q: Is this all worth it for a repository of markdown files?
**A:** This isn't just markdown - it's a strategic asset. With enhancements: MCP turns it into an integration platform, quality certification creates defensible moat, workflows enable automation. Total transformation.
